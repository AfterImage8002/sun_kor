He also sees nationalism as a way to revitalize the economy, eroded by the Western powers, advocates citizen participation in the government, and aims to enact policies that benefit them, such as civil rights. Aiming for a true republican state where sovereignty is given to the people, as well as social welfare and modernization against economic inequality, he plans to average the national income by restricting capitalists monopolies and redistributing land. Gu Zhutong favors Minsheng, aiming at industrial development by national capital, and economic development by enhancing educational institutions. Lastly, he intends to build China as a coalition of federated nations rather than as a unitary state.\nHowever, part of him also believes in a more authocratic kind of rule trascending popular opinion, aiming for an authoritarian democratic system where the nation is controlled by a semi-powerful army.

Since his mentor's death, he's been at the forefront as a loyal supporter of national revolution. As leader of the Left Kuomintang, he has a rivalry of contrast and cooperation with Chiang Kai-shek, and after his fall, Wang has led the party to faithfully maintain loyalty both internally and towards Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles. His faction of the Kuomintang regained power as the majority party, bringing another era of Wang Jingwei rule. He now advocates for economic equality and, on the diplomatic side, he insists on one-sided negotiations, one-sided resistance, and a flexible and opportunistic attitude. Through the Kuomintang and the Three Principles, can his reign bring back China's prosperity?"
 POLITICS_LONG_YUN_DESC:0 "Long Yun comes from Yunnan, having pride and love for his home region. After entering a local military academy, he began his career as soldier and steadily expanded his influence by supporting the Governor of Yunnan, Tang Jiyao. Then, in 1927, he was appointed by the central administration commander of the National Revolutionary Army's 38th battalion, as well as governor, earning the moniker of \"King of Yunnan\" for this. He believes in further expanding local powers, and achieving perfect equality between the ethnic minorities and the Han Chinese scattered throughout the country. His ideals secured him the support of many warlords and members of the National Republican Party, a pro-federalism movement formed during the purges by the Chiang Kai-shek administration, becoming its most promising candidate. Elected during the National Federal Convention, he's now the legitimate President. Whether or not he can realize his dream, he carries with him the expectations of all the Chinese people."

According to a statement released by the newly-established Government of National Salvation, the previous administration would've never been able to defeat Japan, making the Chinese people forever slaves of the rising sun, and for that reason they launched a coup to save the country.\n\nIt was rumored that Zhang Xueliang was head of a secret society, the Chinese National Salvation Party, composed mainly of military personnel. As it turns out, the rumors were true. With the coup's success, this secret society is now out in the open, its existence becoming apparent. Its members advocate for fanatic anti-Japanism by fusing Nazi Germany-inspired national socialist ideas with revanchism. Brutal retaliation against the Japanese and their collaborators is already unfolding in various places.\n\nOn the other hand, the Japanese have harshly criticized this Government of National Salvation for being unjust and barbaric, and seem to be considering a counter-retaliation for the atrocities they are committing against their citizens."
