 IND_the_reign_of_bose:0 "The reign of Bose"
 IND_the_reign_of_bose_desc:0 "The British, who ruled India for so long, have been obliterated by our own hand. Those who held us down and oppressed us are gone. But all was not well. The war with Pakistan, the inequality that still lingers, the poor industry, there are so many problems that need to be solved. We must unite again. Under Bose!"
 IND_india_is_still_not_unified:0 "The Yet Disunited India"
 IND_india_is_still_not_unified_desc:0 "India has meanings more than we believe it does. From Pakistan to Burma... No! From Afghanistan to Indochina, from the west to the east of the Indian subcontinent as a hole. Yet, look at our situation. Religion, race, language, all causes turn against integration and cause suffering. We must look forward once again. We must ask ourselves again. What truly is India?"
 IND_political_instability:0 "Political unrest"
 IND_political_instability_desc:0 "At present, the biggest problem in India is political instability. The effects of the Indo-Pakistani War, religious problems, the autonomy historically enjoyed by the Nawabs... we need to keep working on them one at a time. Even if we have to make sacrifices in the process, they will all be for the sake of our dear India."
 IND_strengthen_cooperation_with_the_national_assembly:0 "More Cooperation with the National Congress"
 IND_strengthen_cooperation_with_the_national_assembly_desc:0 "The Indian National Congress was established in 1885 and has been committed to the stability and independence of India ever since. The Mahatma Gandhi and Chandra Bose are also part of it, and are highly trusted by the public. By deepening our relationship with them, we may find a clue to solve our problems."
 IND_issue_of_the_feudal_lord:0 "The Nawab Problem"
 IND_issue_of_the_feudal_lord_desc:0 "Since before the time of British-controlled India, there have been influential people known as \"Nawabs\" in each of our regions. They hold great sway even now that we've achieved independence, and are a huge obstacle to Indian unity and progress. It's inevitable that conflicts involving them will continue to intensify in the future."
 IND_religious_problem:0 "The Religion Problem"
 IND_religious_problem_desc:0 "Many groups of people with different religions live in India: the Hindu majority, the Muslims around Dhaka, the Buddhists, etc. The religious conflicts they all create are potentially divisive for India and, unless this deep-rooted issue is somehow solved, it will be difficult to achieve political stability."
 IND_increasingly_powerful_officers:0 "Increasingly Powerful Officers"
 IND_increasingly_powerful_officers_desc:0 "Japanese officers were a great help in the Independence and Indo-Pakistani wars. Their influence now increases with each passing day, and some even insist on interfering with the government. We need to deal with them before they can ruin the India we aim for. Obviously, conflict is inevitable."
 IND_gandhis_speech:0 "Gandhi's Speeches"
 IND_gandhis_speech_desc:0 "The Mahatma Gandhi has always been on the popular frontline, always close to the people, guiding us during the Independence War. His Non-violence and Disobedience mottos are well known throughout India, and all people who love this country trust him, regardless of religion or race. His words could bring this divided nation together again."
 IND_bengal_problem:0 "The Bengal Problem"
 IND_bengal_problem_desc:0 "Immediately after Indian independence, the Muslim-majority Pakistan became a separate nation. On the other hand, the Bengal region, having a similar composition, remains part of India and suffers from this religious disparity. The recently intensifying riots and demonstrations have this problem as their roots. Aiming for a united India, this issue can't be neglected."
 IND_immature_army:0 "Immature Army"
 IND_immature_army_desc:0 "The Indian National Army has steadily gained experience via the Independence and Indo-Pakistani wars, albeit with Japanese military support. However, the army's morale has been seriously shattered by many problems, like the country's poor industry, the long history of colonial rule, the equipment shortage and the chaotic chain of command."

 IND_creation_air_force_desc:0 "If someone were to ask \"What was the most innovative weapon in World War II?\", the answer would be the aircraft. This new vehicle, able to inflict damage on enemies from far away and far above, changed traditional strategy. So, it's only natural to create the Air Force, an organization capable of comprehensively operating them, in order to ride the tide of this new age and modernize our military."
 IND_reorganization_navy:0 "Reorganize the Navy"
 IND_reorganization_navy_desc:0 "Looking at our long land border with potential enemies, it goes without saying that it's important for us to focus on the Army but, on the other hand, we also have a long coastline. Defending it and blocking our enemies sea is key in order to reduce our potential casualties as much as possible."
 IND_new_national_army:0 "New National Army"
 IND_new_national_army_desc:0 "The Indian National Army, one up with the times and reorganized based on new strategies, weapons, and ideas, is indispensable to frustrate all those wanting to disturb India's peace. So, we mustn't spare any effort for it."
