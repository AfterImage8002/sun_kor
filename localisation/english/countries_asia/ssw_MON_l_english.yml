 MON.1.t:0 "Choibalsan's Plan"
 MON.1.desc:0 "3:00AM. The city of Ulaanbaatar was asleep. However, the lights of an office inside the Army Headquarters were still on. The sound of hands pointing and pounding on a desk echoed in the otherwise-empty building, the meeting between the Field Marshal and his Generals showing no sign of ending. \"So, how many have you gathered so far?” asked Choibalsan. \"About 700\" Major General Butochiin Tsog replied \"The government wouldn't allow many more.” Hearing this, Choibalsan furrowed his eyebrows: \"That few!? Even though we made the request personally\".\n\n\"It will be difficult, Your Excellency. Please forgive me for this failure.\" Jamyangiin Lhagvasuren intervened. Choibalsan moved to lean forward but restrained himself and tilted back in his chair instead.\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, he spoke: \"Fine. But when the time comes, we'll also need to plan for keeping the arsenal under out control. Can I count on you, Lhagvasuren?\".\n\n\"Of course. However, I'd like you to split your forces a bit.”\n\n\"Fine, I'll do something about it... it's already this late, sorry for keeping you all here so long.\" Choibalsan stood up and wiped his forehead, putting the papers on the desk in a drawer, locking it. As he left, Lhagvasuren ordered the guards to disperse: he'd heard something in the hallway during the meeting."
 MON.1.a:0 "\"Nothing to report, Your Excellency\""
 MON.2.t:0 "The Melancholy of Lhagvasuren"
 MON.2.desc:0 "Lhagvasuren was worried: in his capacity as General, not only was he swamped with military administrative work on a daily basis, but was also entrusted with an important role within General Choibalsan's \"special operation\". Because of that, he hadn't been sleeping well lately. The dark circles under his eyes were conspicuous and he often stumbled, leading him to often get help from his colleague and friend General Dandar. Come to think of it, he hadn't even been able to go horse riding, a hobby of his. The more he thought, the more troubles he would see.\n\nWhen he'd done just about half of his work, he went to army HQ under the pretense of taking a break. The air in Ulaanbaatar was cold, stinging his skin, but he didn't care and kept walking. Finding himself on the main street, he noted it hadn't changed much since 20 years before: what had been the cracks on buildings and the new Communist Party Headquarters, but still nothing worthy of note. But what about the people? The number of officials who wore suits instead of traditional dresses has increased while soldiers, once wearing thick uniforms with folded collars, were donning Russian-styled coats. It seemed that times were indeed changing without him noticing. In other words, he hadn't changed since fighting the Japanese at Khalkhin Gol, being left behind in the past.\n\nSeeing the mountains in the distance, Lhagvasuren felt a little better. They didn't seem to change either, so he must be doing something right. He looked at his watch and realized his break had long been over. However, his steps were relaxed."
