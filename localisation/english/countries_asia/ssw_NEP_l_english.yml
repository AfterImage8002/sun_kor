 SSW_NEP.0.title:0 "The Kingdom of the Himalayas"
 SSW_NEP.0.desc:0 "For this small South Asian country, the last decade's global conflict has caused problems that could affect its own national polity. Compared to the de-facto rule of the Rana family for the last 100 years, the original Shah dynasty's own tenure is ceremonial. Forces arguing that the latter should be returned to its original position are collaborating with those in the Nepali Parliament calling for democratization, resulting in the formation of an anti-Rana movement. So far, the Rana Prime Minister Mohan has cracked down on this trend, but the country is faced with a serious decision: should his policy be changed or continued?"

 SSW_NEP.1.desc:0 "Support for the anti-Rana faction, increasing with every passing day, didn't give Mohan any reason to change the current policy. He once again showed strong confidence that the current situation of Nepal, where the Ranas' popularity strongly overwhelms the Shah dynasty's, is legitimate. However, contrary to his belief, it's clear that anti-Rana momentum isn't going to slow down any time soon."

Tribhuvan is indispensable for establishing a constitutional monarchy with a popular government, goal of the Nepali Congress, first amongst the anti-Rana factions. This event shows that, by not daring to anger the ruling family, the Indians don't support the anti-Rana cause. Either way, this is good news for us."

While India has a deep connection with the Shah dynasty, of which Tribhuvan is a member, it also has a friendly relationship with the Ranas, who currently rule over Nepal. Rejecting their request will definitely worsen our relations, but on the other hand, it can encourage the Nepalese anti-Rana faction and lead us to a beneficial situation in the future. One last thing to keep in mind is that a nation that turns down those in need is untrustworthy."

Kathmandu is now under the control of the Nepali Congress, which advocates for a constitutional monarchy with a popular government.
