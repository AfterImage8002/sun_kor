 sswper.1.title:0 "Start of the Reforms"
 sswper.1.desc:0 "Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi has declared that, since the necessary funds and equipment have been gathered, the \"White Revolution\" can begin.\n\nAt the same time, he also declared (but hasn't yet enforced) that parliament will be suspended until the reforms are concluded, due to their past attempts at blocking any kind of change. After the announcement, a variety of articles either praising or criticizing the Shah are being published by every news outlet in the country."
 sswper.1.a:0 "Long live the Shah!"
 sswper.2.title:0 "Resistance to the Reforms"
 sswper.2.desc:0 "The Shah's reforms are producing some results, but...\n\nConservatives, arguing that Western-style education goes against Islam, and technocrats, who believe that rapid modernization will lead to inflation and a widening of the rich-poor wealth gap, are equally outraged at the new policies enacted.\n\nIf we don't do something about this, the reforms may not succeed..."
 sswper.2.a:0 "This is the reason parliament was suspended"
 sswper.3.title:0 "Davud Monshizadeh Returns"
 sswper.3.desc:0 "Davud Monshizadeh, professor at the Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich and former SS member, has returned to Iran due to the improvement of our relations with Germany.\n\nMeanwhile, there are rumors that the German technical advisors, who arrived at about the same time, includes members of the Gestapo, leading some to believe that this will have some effect on the Shah's reforms, and on those opposing them."
 sswper.3.a:0 "This will silence the opposition"
 sswper.4.title:0 "Concessions to the Conservatives"
 sswper.4.desc:0 "As the voice of the opposition grows louder, the Shāh has announced he will cooperate with conservative Islamic leaders and will immediately allow parliament to reopen. \n\nA coalition with conservatives elements will help silence the opposing technocrats but, while economic policies may continue as planned, the education reform will have to be toned down."
 sswper.4.a:0 "Better this than failure..."
 sswper.5.title:0 "Concessions to the Technocrats"
 sswper.5.desc:0 "As the voice of the opposition grows louder, the Shāh has announced he will cooperate with the liberal technocratand will immediately allow parliament to reopen. \n\nA coalition with technocratic elements will help silence the opposing conservatives but, while our education policies may continue as planned, the economic reform will have to be toned down."
 sswper.5.a:0 "Better this than failure..."
 sswper.6.title:0 "King of Kings"
 sswper.6.desc:0 "As the voice of the opposition grows louder, the Shāh has announced the continuation of the reforms and the indefinite suspension of parliament.\n\nProtesters have quickly gathered in the streets of Tehran, calling for the Shah to abdicate. Will the Imperial State be able to finish its reforms?"
 sswper.6.a:0 "No parliament should question the Shah"
 sswper.7.title:0 "Working with the Italian Government"
 sswper.7.desc:0 "As the voice of the opposition grows louder, the Shāh has announced he will accelerate the reforms by working with the Italian government.\n\nThe news that a successful and developed country will back the reforms has eased public concerns, while some ardent Muslims have criticized our ties with Christian Italy as disrespectful of Islam."
 sswper.7.a:0 "More friends the better"
 sswper.8.title:0 "Deal with the Opposition"
 sswper.8.desc:0 "The reforms are progressing smoothly despite the concessions we made, but opposition from the faction we didn't appease is seeing an increase.\n\nThey shouldn't pose a threat as long as we are getting results and have allies in parliament, but it would be better to deal with them."
 sswper.8.a:0 "Tell SAVAK to deal with them"
 sswper.9.title:0 "The Reforms Continue"
 sswper.9.desc:0 "Our reforms, once interrupted by parliament with its opposition, are now progressing smoothly, albeit with foreign assistance.\n\nHowever, the fact that a small number of dissident is attempting to block the reforms is also true. If we don't address the issue, the reforms can't possibly succeed."
 sswper.9.a:0 "With this, everything will turn out alright"
 sswper.10.title:0 "Compensation"
 sswper.10.desc:0 "Dear Imperial Guard member,\n\nwe, the Technical Advisors, have successfully modernized the Empire. Therefore, we suggested to the Shah to suspend parliament indefinitely and make us \"councillors\" as \"compensation\". Unfortunately, he misunderstood our intentions and declined.\n\nOn a different note, your cooperation has been invaluable in carrying out the reforms. As a reward for your help, we've decided to invite you to a small party on the \"morning the eagle hatches\", and we'd be delighted if you joined.\n\nSincerely,\nthe German Technical Advisors"
 sswper.10.a:0 "... what a wonderful invite"
 sswper.11.title:0 "The Morning the Eagle Hatches"
 sswper.11.desc:0 "The Shāh Mohammad Rezā Shāh Pahlavi believed that the reforms he initiated were successful, and that the prosperity of the empire and the rule of the shahs would continue forever.\n\nIn reality, he's nothing more than a king in name only, surrounded in his palace, betrayed by his Imperial Guards.\n\nSUMKA will now control this country, with the Shah as a mere puppet to their ambitions."
 sswper.11.a:0 "Sieg Heil!"
 sswper.12.title:0 "The Parliament Problem"
 sswper.12.desc:0 "The reforms proposed by the Shah were successfully completed with the help of the Pan-Iranianist Party and our Italian friends, but some MPs seem to be calling for parliament to resume.\n\nLike the Shah, we believe that a parliament that only gets in the way of change is unnecessary, but it seems that troublesome elements are gaining support among those harmed by the reforms. While their influence is negligible, it wouldn't hurt to deal with them sooner rather than later."
 sswper.12.a:0 "Problems must be nipped in the bud"
 sswper.13.title:0 "The White Revolution"
 sswper.13.desc:0 "The Shah has declared that the White Revolution (the collective name for all the reform plans proposed by the Shah) is complete.\n\nThe volume of the reforms, which include agriculture, industry, education and other matters of vital interests, led many to believe they would take a long time to finish, but the indefinite suspension of parliament and SAVAK's dissident purges accelerated the process considerably.\n\nHowever, many within the country believe the reforms to have been too radical, increasing the strain on society and on the economy. As a result, protests have intensified in Tehran, while Islamic scholars have lashed out at the Shah for his secularization efforts.\n\nDid the “White Revolution” really succeed?"
 sswper.13.a:0 "If the Shah says so..."
 sswper.14.title:0 "Protests"
 sswper.14.desc:0 "After the end of the \"White Revolution\" was declared, protesters have been demonstrating around the imperial palace in Tehran.\n\nMost of them are anti-secularization Muslims, but rumor has it that the infamous Communist Party is leading a group of workers, fearful of the rapid economic reform, to the capital. Regardless of it being true or not, taking no action will only make the situation worse."
 sswper.14.a:0 "I have a bad feeling about this..."
 sswper.15.title:0 "Lethal Force"
 sswper.15.desc:0 "Today was the Imperial State's worst day... rather, the worst day, period.\n\nPossibly tired of the demonstrators that every day gathered in front of the imperial palace, the Shah gave permission to open fire on them in his haste for their immediate removal.\n\nThe order was carried out with great zeal, leaving only red stains and bullet husks in front of the palace grounds.\n\nThe Shah was reportedly very happy that the protesters were dispersed, but his smile would soon fade..."
 sswper.15.a:0 "We need to gather only the most trustworthy of men..."
 sswper.16.title:0 "Collapse"
 sswper.16.desc:0 "The shooting of the protesters was reported on by the national media outlets and the people, feeling threatened, were quick to join anti-establishment factions to protect themselves, while more extremist elements acted with a clear intent to kill the Shah.\n\nThis morning, some of the SS rebelled and attacked the palace, completely destroying an empire that had been hanging on by a thread.\n\nWhile the Shah fled east, the Islamic fundamentalists occupying the capital proclaimed the birth of an Islamic Republic, while in the south oil field workers and communists have staged an unprising."
 sswper.16.a:0 "It's the beginning of the end"
 sswper.17.title:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
 sswper.17.desc:0 "Ever since the Kurdish people were partitioned in ancient times, the Kurdish minority in western Iran has been subject to persecution.\n\nHowever, due to the chaos engulfing the country, most of the Persian garrison left to fight on the eastern front.\n\nSeeing this as an opportunity for Kurdistan's independence, Qazi Muhammad gathered Kurds at home and abroad and rose up in revolt.\n\nThis uprising was so massive that it even affected Turkey and Iraq."
 sswper.17.a:0 "Those damn Kurds..."
 sswper.18.title:0 "The Iranian Civil War"
 sswper.18.desc:0 "The Shah's attempt at reform in Iran has failed.\n\nCurrently, the country is in the midst of a civil war between monarchists, Islamic fundamentalists, communists, and Kurds.\n\nThis conflict in one of the largest oil-producing countries in the Middle East will surely have an impact on the price of oil around the world."
 sswper.18.a:0 "Does anybody know how much we have in reserves?"
 sswper.19.title:0 "The Bahrain Problem"
 sswper.19.desc:0 "Bahrain was once a territory of the Safavid dynasty and, as a result, the Muslim population on the island is predominantly Shia.\n\nCurrently one of the constituents of the United Arab Emirates, if we instigate them, we could easily get them to leave the union."
 sswper.19.a:0 "That island is ours!"
 sswper.20.title:0 "Bahrain Secedes"
 sswper.20.desc:0 "Our special forces and the enflamed citizenry got things done promptly and smoothly.\n\nThe Emir of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, was captured and citizen representatives declared Bahrain's secession from the union and integration with Iran.\n\nThe central government of the United Arab Emirates has expressed utter outrage, but their protest will be of no consequence."
 sswper.20.a:0 "It once belonged to us, no?"
