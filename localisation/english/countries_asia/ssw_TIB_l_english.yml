 TIB_14th_dalai_lama_desc:0 "The 14th Dalai Lama, spiritual name Tenzin Gyatso, was born in a local farmer's family in Amdo, ascending to the throne at 4 years of age. He's the symbol of Buddhism, being its highest authority, and is also the head of state of Tibet.\n\nHowever, because of his young age, a regency has been established to rule Tibet in his stead. Even in this situation, the world is rapidly changing, and the time will come when he'll be forced to make a choice."

 tibet.1000.desc:0 "This morning, a monk arrived from India. We don't exactly know how he got here, but it seems that he crossed Sikkim and reached Lhasa via Gyantse.\n\nHe said he came to Lhasa to have an audience with the Dalai Lama, after he had allegedly met with the political advisor Ernst Schäfer, speaking fluent German. He called himself Lhunpolto Rinpoche, legal name Thupten Thimler Henrich. When Schäfer interviewed him, he saw his intellect worthy for leading Tibetan politics, so he recommended him to the Dalai Lama to serve as regent, replacing the politically-insecure Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen. Members of monasteries and Kashag who are dissatisfied with the current regent also agree.\n\nAccording to a renowned monk, he may be the light that will brighten Tibet's future."

 POLITICS_TSARONG_DZASA_DESC:0 "§WTsarong Dzasa was born in 1888, named Namgang Dazang Damdu, into a peasant family in Phempo. Due to his high intelligence, he was bought to serve the 13th Dalai Lama, becoming one of his closest aides during his visit to Mongolia. During the Qing expedition to Tibet of 1910, he helped defend the country and was hailed as \"the hero of Chaksam\" by the people. After that, he was involved in overall modernization projects, sparing no effort to develop Tibet even after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama. Before and after World War II, he was an important figure advocating for economic reforms in Tibet, and in recognition for his achievements, he served the Dalai Lama again as Kalon Tripa (prime minister).§!"
