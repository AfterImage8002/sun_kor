 TMS_legitimate_iron_rule_desc:0 "The NKVD's rule caused dissatisfaction among the residents, as well as agricultural and economic stagnation, but the majority of the population still supports the disciplined, legitimate government, refusing to fall under fascists backed by foreign powers. No matter how chaotic the economy and policies are, the NKVD's control is absolute, as is its superiority over the fascist rabble."

 TMS_rulers_from_unfamiliar_lands_desc:0 "Since local leaders were purged during Stalin's Great Purge, non-Turkmeni from elsewhere came to rule this land. The gap between people and leaders deepened at first, but it then seemed to close as the two tried to understand each other. However, in order to quell turmoil in the Turkmeni Soviet Socialist Republic following the defeat in the Great Patriotic War, the NKVD puppeted Turkmen Communist Party leader Yakov Chubin and, with their decision to continue the Great Purge, the connection between residents and leadership was severed, and the Turkmeni were shrouded in darkness."
 POLITICS_YAKOV_CHUBIN_DESC:0 "Yakov Chubin was born into a Jewish family in the Belarusian province of Mogilev. Siding with the Red Army during the revolution, he then steadily advanced his career as a worker union secretary and party bureaucrat. When Stalin's Great Purge began, he was sent to the Turkmeni Soviet Socialist Republic in order to replace its previous leader.\n\nHowever, the crisis was destined to befall him. The NKVD put together evidence against Chubin, creating a situation in which he could be purged at any time. This situation allowed the NKVD to blackmail him into giving them even more power: no one in Turkmenistan, apart from Stalin, could stop them. Chubin, terrified of being purged, doesn't have the courage to defy the NKVD.\n\nIf he's to forge his own path, it will be imperative to enlist the help of someone not affiliated with his blackmailers."
