On the other hand, in the [CHI.GetName] most railroads have standard gauges of 1435mm, which poses a major obstacle in the transportation of goods. Now that our relationship with the [CHI.GetName] is deepening, it's extremely important to adhere to the standardized ones. However, changing all of the nation's railways requires lots of money and time. Therefore, some in the government have argued that we should update only the major ones."

Although there were some difficulties, such as technical problems and shortages of supplies along the way, we were able to proceed in a way not so different from the original schedule, due to the exquisite discretion of the technicians dispatched from the [CHI.GetName], and the on-site supervisors. The completion of this powerful railway network, reminiscent of the nervous system, will provide more than enough supplies to every corner of the country, and will support further industrialization and economic development."

However, as of late some linguists and politicians have argued that Chu Nom should be revived instead. This claims could be caused by Chinese influence, since this alphabet uses their characters, and the need to maintain friendly relations with them, or by the desire to revive our old traditions. On the other end, some people are worried that since the Chinese-based characters of Chu Nom are rather difficult, the literacy rate will drop as a result, and so the controversy between the two writing systems continues.\nTo put an end to the squabbling, we'll eventually have to decide which one to use."

Furthermore, the defeated Viet Minh went underground again and have resumed their terrorist activities. We must unite the people's hearts and eliminate all obstacles for a true unification of Vietnam."

However, the effects of colonial rule are still being felt, as we haven't yet been able to modernize. By accepting Chinese protection, the influence of Overseas Chinese in our economy got stronger and stronger. On the other hand, the French are desperate to regain their former privileges, as the Banque de l'Indochina hasn't lost its sway yet. We need to control the influence of each faction, aiming towards healthy economic competition and preventing any of them from forming a monopoly."
