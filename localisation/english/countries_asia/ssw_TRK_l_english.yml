 TRK_liberated_soldiers_desc:0 "Dragging ourselves out of the camps after a long and painful battle with the wretched Germans, we have finally reached Turkestan. With the Germans out of the picture and no one holding us back, we'll fight to liberate this great land! With our army of Kazakhs, Turks, Uzbeks and other ethnicities, we won't stop until the Turkic peoples are completely free."
 TRK_two_factions:0 "The Two Factions"
 TRK_two_factions_desc:0 "The Turkestan Legion has continued to expand, creating clear factional conflicts. Veli Hayuum Khan, head of the Turkestan National Unity Committee, advocates for German-style National Socialism. Mustafa Shokay, active since the days of Imperial Russia, aims to oppose him alongside his creation, the National Revolutionary Party."
 TRK_untrusted_from_people:0 "Popular Distrust"
 TRK_untrusted_from_people_desc:0 "Far from being welcomed by the Turkmeni as liberators, the foreign-backed and disorganized Legion has come to be strongly distrusted. Most residents support Communists or local rulers, so the Legion must make various efforts to win popular support. It's clear that the help of the people is essential to complete the liberation of Turkestan."
 TRK_Turkestan_war_liberation:0 "The Turkestani Liberation War"
 TRK_Turkestan_war_liberation_desc:0 "Turkestan has been exposed to Russian control for hundreds of years, its people driven out of their lands by forced assimilation and resettlement by the vicious imperial government. Even after the Bolsheviks came, the oppression never changed, and Turkestan suffered great damage under the Great Purge and the ethnic migrations.\n\nThe name Turkestan had been forgotten under this severe oppression, and many feared it would become an integral part of Russia, but the situation changed with the arrival of the Wehrmacht during World War II. When Germany sensed that the war was going to be a long one, it began to organize collaborationist units made up of ethnic minorities from each region of the Soviet Union. Among them, was our Turkestan Legion. The war ended in a negotiated German victory, but their army never reached the Urals, let alone Turkestan.\n\nRealizing that a decisive blow was essential, the Legion, supported by Turkey and Germany, crossed the Caspian Sea and landed in Turkmenistan. The Turkestan Liberation War has just begun. The time has come to liberate the entire region and break the Russian chain!"
 TRK_Korsirmat_institution:0 "Korshirmat Agency"
 TRK_Korsirmat_institution_desc:0 "Korshirmat is a legendary general of the Turkestan Legion who was originally part of the pan-Turkic and pan-Islamic Basmachi independence movement, which occurred during the Russian Civil War. With the Legion's landing, he returned from his exile in Afghanistan to contribute with his military know-how. Experienced in guerrilla warfare, an agency bearing his name is needed to carry out sabotage throughout the Turkestan region."
 TRK_supporter:0 "Supporter"
 TRK_supporter_desc:0 "The Legion has a strong backers: Turkey with its pan-Turkic policy, and Germany, which also played a central role in creating it. It goes without saying that their support is one of the most decisive and important factors to win this war."
 TRK_remember_root:0 "Remember Our Roots!"
 TRK_remember_root_desc:0 "The soldiers fighting for the Bolsheviks aren't necessarily Turkestan's enemies. Some are Turkic like us, so it's possible they're fighting only due to Stalin's fearful gaze, or that they have been brainwashed with the Bolshevik way. We must liberate them both mentally and physically: those with the same roots as us must fight a holy war against the strong Russo-Bolshevik menace."
 TRK_where_the_bomb:0 "Where is the Bomb?"
 TRK_where_the_bomb_desc:0 "One of Korshirmat's guerrilla tactics is to plant bombs in strongholds we retreat from, as well as other locations likely to be visited by Soviet troops, trying to inflict damage and fear on the enemy, even if only a little. This is being carried out by our soldiers and collaborators within the Soviet military. The enemy won't be able to sleep at night due to the fear they may explode at any moment."
 TRK_what_Bek_left_behind:0 "What Bek Left Behind"
 TRK_what_Bek_left_behind_desc:0 "Ibrahim Bek, leader of the Basmachi independence movement from the Russian Civil War era, is known as a hero of Turkestan liberation. His mastery of guerrilla tactics, as well as the spirit of faith, independence and nationalism of the Basmachi, will be revived during the Turkestan Liberation War."
 TRK_seek_second_Enver:0 "Seek the Second Enver"
 TRK_seek_second_Enver_desc:0 "The heroes of the independence movement weren't from Turkestan. Enver Pasha, for example, is one such example. He was Minister of War of the Ottoman Empire and a radical supporter of the Young Turks. His ideology was pan-Turkish and pan-Islamist. After being defeated in a power struggle against Kemal, he worked with the Turkestan independence movement and died there. The Legion wants someone as charismatic and idealistic as he is. Let's invite a new Enver Pasha from our powerful ally, Turkey, and lead this war to victory!"
 TRK_uprising_hinterland:0 "Uprise in the Hinterland"
 TRK_uprising_hinterland_desc:0 "Doubt, fear and anger against the Russo-Bolshevik regime spread across Turkestan. The spark turning all three emotions into anger, leading to action is undoubtedly the Legion. Korshirmat's fervent groundwork and sabotage efforts have stretched the Bolshevik security forces to their limit, so now is the perfect time to awaken our sleeping agents in the rear."
 TRK_negative_friend:0 "A Reluctant Friend"
 TRK_negative_friend_desc:0 "The Germans, conquerors of the Soviet Union and hegemons of Europe, created our Legion. However, we've taken a passive stance in the war to liberate Turkestan, relying mostly on our ally Turkey for support. Despite our strong blood ties with Turkey, they look powerless in our fight against the Soviet Union, which still maintains an integrated military. So, we must appeal to the German government for help."
 TRK_all_for_sake_Allah:0 "All for Allah"
 TRK_all_for_sake_Allah_desc:0 "In war, the question of \"what you fight for\" is a constant. There are quite a few people who joined our Legion to escape the German camps or to eat. However, without a proper cause, the Legion will find it difficult to continue the war. What holds us together? It's our faith in Allah. Since most of the Legion members are Muslim, we must fight against the Soviets and their denial of Islamic traditions!"
 TRK_for_Turk:0 "For the Turks"
 TRK_for_Turk_desc:0 "Why is this long and painful battle against this mighty enemy being fought? Why have we become strong enough to return to Turkestan? All that is because Turkic blood unites us, while the memory of our ancestors' battles inspires us. Many of our people have been harassed by the Russians since the fall of the Tatars, following the path of servitude.  We have fought so far to stop this evil from continuing, and we will continue to do so!"
 TRK_modern_day_mujahidin:0 "The Modern Mujahidin"
 TRK_modern_day_mujahidin_desc:0 "Islam, our religion, has always been threatened by enemies, but each time jihadists called the Mujahideen gathered to repel these invasions. The defensive battle against Islam's enemies continues even now, as we're fighting a holy war right here in Turkestan. Keeping in mind past Mujahideen heroes - Saladin, Timur and Shamir - we must win this jihad."
 TRK_modern_mamluks:0 "The Modern Mamluks"
 TRK_modern_mamluks_desc:0 "The Mamluks were Turks taken from the lands of Central Asia and Southern Russia to fight as slave-warriors. They were valued as an important military force in the Arab world, going so far as establishing their own empire. Their circumstances are similar to ours: fighting as German and Russian mercenaries, we've returned to Turkestan and are trying to end our history of subjugation. We Turks will bounce back against oppression and walk our own way. History repeats itself."
 TRK_art_national_socialist_strategy:0 "National Socialist Strategy"
 TRK_art_national_socialist_strategy_desc:0 "It's well known in modern nations that the battlefield isn't the only place wars are fought. However, the Legion has experience only on the battlefield. Having established Turkmenistan as a nation, we must establish a modern wartime regime. So, we'll study the German example, the winners of World War II and our patrons, and seek to implement their National Socialist wartime regime in a form suitable for Turkestan."
 TRK_guerrilla_and_flexible_strategy:0 "Flexible Guerrilla Warfare"
 TRK_guerrilla_and_flexible_strategy_desc:0 "German World War II tactics were grand, but far from perfect. Although they won their battle against the Soviets in the end, they suffered enormous damage due to the long war. Moreover, adopting their tactics would be impossible for us, slow to mechanize and with almost no core industries. Only guerrilla tactics, effective during the Basmachi Uprising, could deal an effective blow to the enemy with a small number of weapons and troops we have."
 TRK_nation_wartime_economy:0 "People's War Economy"
 TRK_nation_wartime_economy_desc:0 "War requires money, but also requires people to support our Legion. So, according to National Socialist doctrine, the government will levy taxes for the expansion of armaments, taking care of the daily lives of our people in exchange."
 TRK_war_has_change:0 "War has Changed"
 TRK_war_has_change_desc:0 "Between the time World War II started and ended, common sense changed greatly. Equally important were changes in territory, spheres of influence, economy and warfare. During the war, the each country's weaponry made remarkable progress, tactics changing alongside them. When the Legion was part of the German army, it was given old-fashioned weapons and, because its members got used to them, old tactical ideas latched on to these designs. We need to study all about war to catch up with this new era."
 TRK_proposal_Korsirmat:0 "Korshirmat's Proposal"
 TRK_proposal_Korsirmat_desc:0 "General Korshirmat's sabotage efforts are working better than expected. According to information received from his Agency, more material and officers than ever before are needed to further improve the efficiency and scale of operations. Send them what they need and deal another blow to the Soviet homefront."
 TRK_in_desert_and_mountain:0 "In the Deserts and Mountains"
 TRK_in_desert_and_mountain_desc:0 "Turkmenistan, our battlefield, is mostly desert, with a few mountains and hills in the north and south. Nature turns against both the Soviet Union and the Legion, while sometimes it works to their advantage. In order to outwit the Red Army, we must find a way to fight effectively in these lands, with cooperation from local residents if necessary."
 TRK_let_blood_flow:0 "Bloodshed"
 TRK_let_blood_flow_desc:0 "The number of Soviet troops deployed to Turkmenistan is increasing day by day. On the other hand, our resources are gradually depleting, and one day the army will be swallowed up by waves of enemy forces. We have little time. No matter how much blood is shed, the Turkic's future is doomed if victory isn't achieved..."

 ssw_trk.1.d:0 "Korshirmat was more enthusiastic about this war than most, but when he looked around, he only saw green officers who don't know right from left, Islamic teachers, and soldiers who just drink and play with their comrades. Needless to say, this wasn't good for military discipline.\n\nHe's so zealous that, when the Legion landed in Bäherden, he rushed from Afghanistan to join, believing in the dream of the liberation of all Turkestan.  Yet, the fact that his enthusiasm would somewhat decrease once he knew of the army's disastrous situation couldn't be helped. Even so, he never thought they had no chance of winning. The situation in the Red Army was even more dire, as their morale continued to deplete following their defeat against Germany. So, the optimism of the Legion soldiers, based on their knowledge of the Soviets' situation, made him feel a little better.\n\nThat's right, there's still a chance to win. Convinced of this, Korshirmat began to seriously think about how to lead them to victory. What contributed most to this was the memories of his past battles. His participation in the Basmachi uprising of the 1920s led him to conclude that guerrilla tactics were effective against Soviet forces, even more so now that they were stiffened and disorganized by defeat. However, at the same time, he felt anger rising against the Soviet Union, which suppressed of the uprising with great cruelty. Yes, it was a requiem for his compatriots oppressed by the Soviet regime. With a strange excitement, he visited the Legion's leader, Hayuum Khan, to inform him of his plan."

It's Korshirmat again!\" one of those who rushed to the scene shouted.\n\nThe platoon prepared for combat in case any enemies were lurking nearby, but there appeared to be none hiding in the requisitioned house. Then, the injured soldier opened his eyes after regaining consciousness. \"We opened that door! Then the guy in front of me suddenly got blown away, and I got caught up in the blast!\" he explained.\n\nAll soldiers who heard about the incident recognized the explosion as part of the recent increase in sabotage in the rear lines. In particular, the \"Korshirmat Agency\", which the enemy widely advertised both domestically and externally, seemed to be focusing on terrorist activity under the guide of a general who fought for the Basmachi in the 1920s, who was now causing chaos among the Soviet forces fighting in Turkestan. While a message received from the top brass said \"Don't be afraid, the enemy is weak\", the platoon's consensus was that something needed to be done about the attacks and the damages."

Shedding blood on the same battlefield during the war and completing the crusade against the Russians and Bolshevism forged a strong bond between the Turkic and Germanic peoples. Eliminating our common enemy from this world truly was a historical achievement. However, Bolshevik remnants still reside here in the East, eagerly awaiting an opportunity for retaliation. We, the Turkestan Legion, continue our fight alone against this dangerous enemy. The strength of the great Germanic people is essential for a complete victory over the Russo-Bolsheviks, the enemies of this Earth. Please consider supporting our Legion for the prosperity of both races, as well as the world's.\n\nSincerely,\nChairman of the Turkestan National Unity Committee, Veli Hayuum Khan"

The nostalgic taste of food, his family home, and the beautiful blue meadows. No life-threatening bombs or Korshirmat minions here! After thinking that, he reminded himself to pray for the safety of his comrades left on the battlefield later.\n\nRelieved at first, Bulat then heard the sounds of the battlefield in his homeland. A tremendous explosion followed by smoke could be seen coming from the army garrison in a neighboring town. He believed he was dreaming, but the chaos around him soon made him realize it was all real.\n\nTwo days later, NKVD agents came to interrogate Bulat. According to them, various terrorist attacks by the Korshirmat Agency had occurred in the area for the past few days. The former soldier felt discouraged, worrying there was no safe place in Central Asia and that the enemy was closing in on his homeland, but all he could do now was stand there helplessly."

The front was already engulfed in chaos.\n\nThe time for the Legion's final battle is approaching. Holding this belief, Hayuum Khan gave his last command. This \"blood order\" was reckless and aggressive: it entailed an endless suicide attack tactic on the Soviet \"no step back\" model."

 ssw_trk.6.d:0 "Having fully established our sphere of influence in the region with our great victory in the Turkestan Liberation War, we now have to establish a new government, taking a giant step towards the liberation of all Turkestan. To that end, the creation of a National Council is essential: currently, we're focusing on gathering councilmen to establish said system.\n\nNominated by government officials, they're split between Veli Hayuum Khan, Chairman of the National Unity Committee, and Mustafa Chokay of the National Revolutionary Party, making full show of the traditional power struggle within the Legion.\n\nThe National Council has decided to use its first resolution to elect the President and, since the faction that secures the majority of the seats will surely be able to choose who will take the position, both cliques seem desperate to secure enough councilmen to curtail the other."

Evidence of this is the Council's recent election of the new President, who now leads a minority government due to obstructionism by both groups. In such a climate, carrying out a vote is difficult.\n\nMembers of each faction verbally abuse each other, and it's not uncommon to see some of them resort to violence. Mustafa Chokay and Veli Hayuum Khan have both expressed serious concern, but have shown no sign of wanting to compromise, arguing that the other is responsible."

Overnight, as many as eight councilmen were victims of this, with most belonging to the majority faction.\n\nIn response, the National Council was adjourned indefinitely, leading many to declare that the body was effectively abolished.

First, he enlisted the help of independent councilmen, while also gaining the support of the soldiers who fought under him in the liberation war. Chokay and Hayuum Khan, to occupied with political unrest and mutual terrorism to notice Korshirmat's movements, allowed his forces to storm the National Council and other government buildings.\n\nHaving caputured the capital, Korshirmat issued a statement before the reconvened National Council: \"Mustafa Chokay and Veli Hayuum Khan are both guilty of treason, corruption and conspiracy against Turkestan, for which they shall be sentenced to life inprisonment.

However, their forces were defeated by the Red Army, making their attempt to take Turkestan end in total failure.\n\nMost of the remnants of the Turkestan Legion have either been taken prisoner or have crossed the Caspian Sea and returned to Germany. Meanwhile, large-scale reconstruction projects have begun in Soviet Turkestan, the current challenge for the victorious regime being how quickly they can repair the damages caused by the Legion."

Contrary to the expectations of both Germany and the Soviet Union, they seem to have succeeded.\n\nThis military success had a major impact on Soviet Central Asia: in various places of this area, pro-independence forces supported by the Legion and the Germania Accord have already declared the birth of new and independent nations. However, Soviet influence remains strong in Kazakhstan, where conflict between the weak independentist forces and the Red Army is still ongoing.\n\nNow that the Legion has gained power, the internal power struggle present since its inception seems to be intensifying. Also, the rapidly expanding Turkestani Army may soon need to face new challenges."

Feeding this bloated army comes at the expense of great maintenance costs: §rif the allocated funds run out, the soldiers will lose their will to fight and lead us to collapse.§! The other concern is the Soviet Union's power. §rIn the event they regain full control over Turkestan, they will launch an all-out offensive on our positions.§! If that happens, adding to our inferior manpower and resources, victory will become impossible."
