 SSW_TUR.1.d:0 "Turkey, by rejecting Germany's call to arms and choosing to stay out of World War II, is in a state of diplomatic isolation. The only way to solve this problem may be to approach Italy, which seeks hegemony over the Mediterranean."

 SSW_TUR.2.t:0 "Education Policy"
 SSW_TUR.2.d:0 "We have stabilized our economic situation and strengthened the domestic industry. However, that's just the tip of the iceberg. Improving our education standards is essential to increase our power as a foundation to support the nation with. More and more people in the country are suffering from poverty, or from ethnic discrimination, making them unable to receive a satisfactory education. What kind of policy should we pursue?"

 SSW_TUR.3.t:0 "State of the Turkish industry"

 SSW_TUR.3.a:0 "We'll never give up"
 SSW_TUR.4.t:0 "The Army Reconstruction Plan"
 SSW_TUR.4.d:0 "Turkey didn't fight in World War II, and the effect it had on our Army was making its doctrines outdated. The mighty military of yore no longer exists. The reconstruction of the Turkish Army is an important issue: new strategies, such as Germany's blitzkrieg and Japan's planned invasions, were also devised. We may also need to choose new tactics in order to accommodate with modern warfare."
 SSW_TUR.4.a:0 "It's a serious matter"
 SSW_TUR.5.t:0 "Selecting a Doctrine"
 SSW_TUR.5.d:0 "The German Reich was able to conquer its surrounding nations in a short period of time through tank-based maneuver warfare. The Empire of Japan quickly captured the Pacific Islands and devastated the United States by using a well-planned and motivated army. However, we don't have their spirituality, nor their industrial power. What tactics will benefit Turkey?"

 SSW_TUR.6.t:0 "The Religion Issue"
 SSW_TUR.6.d:0 "Turkey has long existed between Asia and Europe. Partly because of that, religious problems have frequently occurred. For example, the Hagia Sophia: a symbol of the Byzantine Empire, when it was converted into an Islamic mosque, it caused a dispute between Orthodox and Muslims. Even today, Istanbul remains an Orthodox sanctuary.\nFor the future of Turkey, how can we deal with this historical and spritual problem?"
 SSW_TUR.6.a:0 "Nothing is as useful and uncontrollable as religion"
 SSW_TUR.7.t:0 "About our Working Environments"
 SSW_TUR.7.d:0 "Turkey's industry is weak because it follows the old ways, as does its working environment. An economy that can only be flourish by mobilizing children and women can no longer be said to benefit the nation. Regarding their treatment, for many years politicians promised that the matter would be considered, but no action was ever taken.\nWhat type of labor does a true national economy consist of?"
 SSW_TUR.7.a:0 "It may be necessary to change the old ways"
 SSW_TUR.8.t:0 "About the Ethnic Groups"
 SSW_TUR.8.d:0 "Originally, Turkey was a nation-state where nomadic people gathered. However, with the expansion of the Ottoman Empire, many ethnic groups found themselves inside our borders. The situation continues to this day, with independence and autonomy movements becoming more active, especially in the eastern regions; the government is being put under pressure for a response to this crisis.\nWhether to respect their diversity or have them serve the Turkish state, a choice has to be made now."
 SSW_TUR.8.a:0 "Diversity can sometimes be a difficult matter"
 SSW_TUR.9.t:0 "The First Middle East Conference"
 SSW_TUR.9.d:0 "The Empire of Japan seized control of the East, Germany became the hegemon of Europe, Italy tried to revive the Roman Empire by holding key points of the Mediterranean, and the British and French nations are waiting for the right moment to exact revenge. In recent years, we in the Middle East have been paying attention to the great powers, alongside improvements in oil excavation technology. Furthermore, with our increased national awareness, conflicts between Jewish immigrants and other races are intensifying. Have we lost our spirit of believing in the same Islamic teachings and uniting against enemies like the Crusaders?\nNo, we haven't. We simply couldn't form a free, unified nation. No one should take away this blessing given by Allah. Now it's time to unite and regain our past Islamic glory."
 SSW_TUR.9.a:0 "Our hearts are one"
 SSW_TUR.10.t:0 "About Plans for Development"
 SSW_TUR.10.d:0 "After the war, it was confirmed that a large amount of oil lies in the Middle East. This brings great benefit to us, but it also means that the great powers of the east and the west will try to interfere in our affairs. We are confident that developing the already active oil fields on our own will prevent other countries from seizing them, as well as increase economic cohesion.\nOnly relatives need hold hands. All one has to do is cut off the hands of those who do not believe in God's teachings."
 SSW_TUR.10.a:0 "Islam's treasures are only ours to take"
 SSW_TUR.11.t:0 "The Damascus Middle Eastern Unity Conference"
 SSW_TUR.11.d:0 "In recent years, a large amount of oil reserves have been found in the Middle East. This may not necessarily be a good thing. Even if a large amount of resources is found, many of the beasts that surround us will try to take them for themselves. Moreover, the Middle East was once united and based on the same Islamic ideas, but now it's in a state of division: we live in a similar climate, read the same Quran, and pray to Allah every day. Why are we so similar yet divided for the benefit of each individual?\nThere may be a small number of opponents and people with different ideas than us. Now is time to overcome such barriers, cross the desert, cross the sea, fly in the sky, and establish a nation with the purpose of praying to our God."

While under foreign rule, there were many conflicts between the various ethnic groups, as well as a dispute with Turkey over Hatay. Besides this, unification is an attractive proposal, if only to counter the great powers.\nWhat kind of response should we, who truly think of our home country, give?"

However, the outcome of the war made this difficult to achieve. Also, in recent years, large reserves of petroleum have been confirmed. God can't advise us whether to join the Turkish state again, or to rely on another nation.\nWhat kind of response should we, who truly think of our home country, give?"

 TUR_Turkish_Economy_in_Recovery:0 "Recovering Turkish Economy"
 TUR_Turkish_Economy_in_Recovery_desc:0 "The Turkish economy was severely damaged by the trade recession caused by World War II. To counteract this, Turkey sought to stabilize the nation through war, putting further pressure on the economy in the form of military expenditures. After the war, in order to rebuild the declining economy, Turkey deepened its economic ties with Germany and invested heavily in Germany's Caucasian and other eastern colonies. Thanks to this, the Turkish economy is gradually recovering. However, it remains unstable and, if the state were to lose its interests in any way, it would be back to square one."
 TUR_fevzi_cakmak_desc:0 "Born in Istanbul to a family active in the military, Cakmak went on to follow in his father's footsteps by studying at three military academies and having a successful career. His first commission was a security operation in the Balkans, followed by suppression of a rebellion in Albania, fighting in the Italian-Turkish War, and commanding units in Syria during World War I.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Sèvres, he sided with Mustafa Kemal against the Ottomans, leading the Turkish Revolution to success, repelling the Greek invasion, and becoming second Marshal of the Republic. After the Turkish Republic repelled its enemies and stabilized, Cakmak devoted himself to military service, serving as General Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces for 19 years, until the coup d'état of 1943.\n\nEven while the post-Kemalist Inönü government was unable to cope with the turmoil caused by World War II, he continued to devote itself to military service, taking an apolitical attitude, but when the German-backed pan-Turkic coup occurred, he accepted the Presidency to protect the nation. After taking office, Cakmak began working hard to save the country while negotiating with the radical ministers led by Nihal Atsiz. Having served in it for a long time, Cakmak reorganized the Army, leading it to victory in the wars against the Soviet Union and in the Middle East. In response to the post-war economic crisis, he repeatedly negotiated with Germany to pave the way for economic recovery.\n\nMarshal Feviz Cakmak, the Guardian of Turkey, respected Kemal, but still approved the coup and worked with Germany, also bringing upon him the hatred of the enthusiastic Kemalists due to his deviation from secularism. However, the Marshal will protect the nation and strive for strong international influence, and as long as he's here, Turkey will never fall."
