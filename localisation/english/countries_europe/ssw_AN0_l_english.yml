They were an independent force headed by Bronislav Kaminsky. Kaminsky, a soldier in the former Red Army, had acted as a member of the pro-Nazi forces during the Second World War, and had treated the anti-German forces with the same harshness as the SS. Later they joined the SS, but Kaminsky disappeared from the public eye. Will they continue to act as pro-Nazis organization in Russia now that the Nazis have retreated, or have they changed their minds and stood up for the independence of Russia and the Slavs...?"

It must be noted that he's a rabid anti-semite: he has a history of assassinating pro-semite Russians living in Germany, so there's the possibility that actions no different from those of Nazi Germany will take place in the territories he'll conquer."
