 rona.1.t:0 "Conference with the Reichskommissar"
 rona.1.desc:0 "The political leader of the Russian Liberation Army (RONA), briefly met with Siegfried Kasche, Reichskommissar of Moskowien, and the pro-German Shtrik-Shtrikfeldt.\nIn the meeting, relations between RONA, the Reichskommissariat, and Germany were discussed. In exchange for our assistance, we have received assurances that we will receive some kind of compensation. The details of this \"kind of compensation\" haven't been determined yet, but it presumably refers to territorial claims.\n\nSupreme Commander Kaminski seems to agree with this outcome, although he has mixed feelings about the whole situation."
 rona.1.a:0 "Help is necessary for a greater Russia"
 rona.2.t:0 "Envoy from the North"
 rona.2.desc:0 "A messenger arrived from the Kaminski Brigade, which was thought to have risen against us in the remote areas around Arkhangelsk, and requested a meeting with Kasche.\nKasche accepted this meeting, resulting in an agreement that the Kaminski brigade will cooperate in exchange for a certain compensation, and won't backstab us. However, the envoy's interpreter stated that \"Kaminski's defection may occur, and you may be asked to help 'handle' that.\" At this moment we can only observe what will happen."
 rona.2.a:0 "It's good to have allies"
 rona.3.t:0 "Hostility towards the Germans"
 rona.3.desc:0 "The Germans oppressed us.\nWe stood at their frontlines, conducted anti-resistance operations on behalf of them and took dirty jobs that the German youth did not want to take. And even more, we must manage our fellow Russians. But still, they hated us and expelled us to Arkhangelsk, distancing us from them. It seems that Kaminski has had enough of this humiliation and is planning to retaliate against the Germans. In other words, what they have done to the Russians, we will do to them!"
 rona.3.a:0 "Blood is only washed away by blood"
 rona.4.t:0 "The Kaminski Brigade Defects"
 rona.4.desc:0 "The RONA, commonly known as the Kaminsky Brigade, was dispatched to Arkhangelsk to eliminate partisans and quell prisoner riots in the area, but has instead exploited the intensification of dissident activity and the mass uprisings to rebel against us! Such an act of betrayal can't ever be forgiven, this being yet another proof of the Slavs' inferiority!\n\"SS-Brigadeführer Bronislav Kaminski\" knows our current situation very well, while we don't know when he'll attack."
 rona.4.a:0 "Them too!"
 rona.5.t:0 "Armed Assault on the Reichskommissariat"

 rona.6.t:0 "Exchanging Blows and Territories"
 rona.6.desc:0 "As in our recent meeting with the Russian Liberation Army, we have sent documents to the Reichskommissar demanding compensation. This may not be very wise, but we can always betray them."

 rona.8.desc:0 "[MOS.GetNameDef] has betrayed our expectations and rejected our request! This is an unforgivable act of malice, and we must remind them by force what it means to turn on us. Konstantin Woskobojnik, who managed the whole affair, will also have to take responsibility for this!"

However, due to its behavior, it has now been relegated to Arkhangelsk and monitor POW camps, taken by many of them as a humiliation.\nCommander Bronislav Kaminski is doing his best for the members' sake, but it's unclear whether they realize this or not."
