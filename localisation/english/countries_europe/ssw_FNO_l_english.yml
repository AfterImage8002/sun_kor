 FNO_event.1.t:0 "Resistance group in Norway seeks aid"
 FNO_event.1.d:0 "Recently, the Norwegian resistance group Milorg (militaer organisasjon) has asked Sweden, through its embassy in the UK, for assistance in their activities. \nWere its support for Norwegian dissidents exposed, this could have a catastrophic effect on bilateral relations for neutral Sweden. But if one were to view this on a different perspective, with German hegemony on the verge of collapse, this may be a perfect opportunity for them to eliminate a constant threat to their existence."

 FNO_event.2.d:0 "After the local resistance rose up, the Free Norwegian Army and Air Force, the military branch of the Norwegian government-in-exile based in London, began landing in the northern city of Narvik, supported indirectly by the Royal Navy.\nThey have been enthusiastically welcomed by the locals, beginning to rush to the front lines in order to fight against the National Government's Army."

 FNO_event.4.t:0 "Emancipation of Norway"
 FNO_event.4.d:0 "After several days of fighting between the Norwegian Liberation Front and the National Government's Army, the Oslo garrison accepted the former's request to surrender, the Reichskommissariat's capital falling into the hands of the Liberation Front. National Government Prime Minister Vidkun Quisling was arrested alongside his ministers by Front soldiers, who rushed into the royal palace - where Quisling had his office - after he ordered all government troops to surrender and cease all fighting.\nNorway, already under Milorg's and the Free Norwegian Army's control, is seeing little resistance from the fascist remnants. This has finally brought an end to German rule, which began with the April 9, 1940 invasion."

However, the fate of the arrested Nasjonal Samling members, the German collaborators, and Prime Minister Vidkun Quisling hasn't been decided yet. Whatever our choice, we certainly need to end the mutual distrust that still exists amongst our people."
