After initially attending a seminary, he dropped out with the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, joining the Red Army. Vlasov began his career as an excellent military man, everyone expecting much from him.\nHe lived up to these expectations, refining all of his troops into elite units.\n\nHowever, he was captured by the Wehrmacht on July 12, 1942, during the German-Soviet War. He could have contacted the Soviet Union at that time but, to Stalin's suspicion, he didn't.\n\nAfter staying in a POW camp for a while, he managed to escape in 1947 by taking advantage of a mass insurrection caused by a partisan attack, living in complete seclusion in Tver. However, with the deteriorating situation in Germany, Russian democratic partisans asked for his cooperation in building a new Russia from the broken remnants of Reichskommissariat Moskowien.\n\nHe has now joined forces with his former Red Army superiors and subordinates, as well as democratic agents, new officers, and young soldiers, doing his best to live up to expectations like in the past.A"

Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov used various names and sent out various messages to the people through newspapers and by mouth. No matter how small his message was, people were interested in it.\n\nAfter the 1941 German Invasion of Russia, he had several contacts with enemy generals seeking to cooperate with them, as he had been arrested by Soviet authorities before. In response, the Germans allowed the establishment of the \"Committee for the Liberation of the Russian Peoples\", in the hope it would help to calm down the resistance, with Zykov being appointed as its de-facto leader. From there, he published the anti-communist magazine \"Zarya\" but, as he deliberately avoided publishing pro-German content, the SS was forced to dissolve it.\n\nAfter the newspaper's dissolution, he lived as a farmer in occupied Bryansk in order to escape the Gestapo, but he decided to join tup with Vlasov and his supporters, revealing himself for the sake of helping to found a new republic.\n\nHaving replaced Vlasov as President, he's trying to build a system neither Bolshevik nor German, with his ultimate goal being a \"strong Russia\"."

He entered seminary, but dropped out at the start of the Russian Revolution, enlisting as a soldier. Fighting against General Denikin and others during the civil war, he was promoted to regimental commander. This wasn't uncommon in early Russia, but it shows that, by that point, he had already demonstrated his skills.\n\nJoined the USSR Communist Party in 1930, became Chief of Staff of the 72nd Division in 1933. By this time he had married, but was forced to divorce during to Stalin's Great Purge, then sent to China as a military advisor and put in charge of training the National Revolutionary Army. Returned home in 1939 and appointed commander of the 99th Sniper Division during the invasion of Finland (the Winter War). Made Major General the following year. After the start of the Great Patriotic War, he was tasked with defending Ukraine as commander of the 37th Army.\n\nDispatched to the Northern Front in the spring of 1942 wirh the aim of reinforcing the siege of Leningrad, he and the city surrendered on July 12. After that, he was shuffled around the POW camps set up in western Russia, spending some time in captivity. He escaped from Rzhev Internment Camp in the summer of 1947, during a major jailbreak caused by a resistance raid, and fled east to Tver.\n\nDuring his time in hiding, the famous Red Army Lieutenant General refused offers of collaboration from various underground organizations. However, perhaps due to a change of mind, he accepted when the Russian Democratic Union contacted him in 1949, establishing the Liberation League and the Russian Liberation Army. Vlasov became representative of the former and Marshal and Commander-in-Chief of the latter. As long as the resistance is organized and fighting, his power won't diminish.\n§YImportant Notes: §Wknown as one of the \"traitors\" of the Soviet Union.§!§!§!§!§!§!"

 RLB.1.desc:0 "Finally, the time had come! Andrei Vlasov adjusted his glasses and nervously climbed the stairs to the podium. The speech prepared by Zykov was already there. Waiting for him to begin were Liberation Army soldiers, political commissars, and generals in uniforms decorated with lapels, epaulettes, and ornamental straps awarded for their services in the German or the Red armies. Vlasov caught his breath when he saw the manuscript entitled the \"Moscow Proclamation.\"\n\n\"Fellow Russians! The time has finally come! The German invaders can no longer harm our nation and we, the Liberation Army, have secured this land. But the military still governs the people, which is in poor taste. So, I hereby declare the establishment of the Russian Republic!\"\n\nThe venue filled with excitement. Vlasov then took office as President and appointed his ministers, promising that elections will be held once the situation calms down. The proclamation was filmed on and conveyed to the public via newspaper. Vlasov promised another thing: a bright future for Russia."

The Liberation Army wasn't as hostile towards communist partisans as the National Liberation Army, on the contrary: except for a few, most didn't mind their arrival. Amid the cold weather, Lieutenant General Boris Permikhin, dispatched as military administrator to the region, was demobilizing former RONA soldiers.\n\nAll the officers and soldiers were of the rank of sergeant and below, as most of the higher ranks had been arrested or had gone into hiding for opposing the Liberation Army. Tired of paperwork, Permikhin prayed the central government to dispatch a governor soon, while the soldiers who were ordered to disperse and regroup later walked around his desk. He then went to the balcony overlooking the Northern Dvina River and began to smoke a cigarette.\n\nAs he finished, a RONA officer in a tattered uniform leaned against the rail next to him. He wasn't among those standing in line earlier... Permikhin addressed him with suspicion: \"Who are you? Judging by uniform and medals, you appear to be of high rank\". \"I am Vladimir Boyarsky, a former RONA commander. General Permikhin, was it? I've something to tell you\", the man spoke in an overly-familiar way, taking out a lighter (probably a Wehrmacht one) and litting the cigarette he was holding in his mouth. \"What is it?\" Permikhin thought dubiously, but didn't really dwell on it too much. \"To put it bluntly, I'd like to join the Liberation Committee. I'm sure you'll be able to help.\"\n\nLater, Permikhin finished his work for the day and wrote a report, which Vlasov received the following day. He stared intently at the words written at the end: \"There is a former National Liberation Army officer wishing to join the Committee.\""
