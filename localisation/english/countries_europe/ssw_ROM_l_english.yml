The two most likely candidates to become the next prime minister are Gheorghe Tatarescu, head of the \"Youth Party,\" and Gheorghe Bratianu, from the Bratianu family, who heads the \"Old People's Party. Gheorghe Tataresque is also known to be an ardent Karolist."
 SSW_ROM.6.a:0 "Gheorghe Tatarescu was chosen."

 SSW_ROM.7.t:0 "Karol II controversy"
 SSW_ROM.7.d:0 "Gheorghe Tatarescu, a member of the \"the Youngs,\" won the election for the post of prime minister. Although his post as prime minister was assured, a bill he proposed was controversial. According to him, the exiled King Carol II would be installed as king again. His party and factions are divided on the issue. There are also rumors that his aides have persuaded him to change his mind. Will the king, who once abandoned his country, be able to return to his homeland?"
 SSW_ROM.7.a:0 "He is NOT the King of Romania."
 SSW_ROM.7.b:0 "He is legitimate the King of Romania."
 SSW_ROM.8.t:0 "Royal Asset"
 SSW_ROM.8.d:0 "Along with the accession of King Carol II to the throne once again, the royal properties that he had taken with him had also been returned to Romania. Some government officials suggested that these should be invested in research institutions in Romania. The people have heard the rumors and are begging for \"mercy\" from the King to use this money. The court marshal refuses to give up their opinion that the money belongs to the royal family. What will be the end result of this enormous wealth?"

 SSW_ROM.9.d:0 "National Revival Front (FRN) is a political party that all citizens are obliged to join, created by the former King Karol II to oppose the Iron Guard and establish his own dictatorship. Although the Iron Guard no longer exists, the current prime minister insists that it should be reinstated in preparation for Hungary and Bulgaria, and the opposition and other factions within the party are naturally opposed to this. They could force it, or they could negotiate a more amicable end."

 SSW_ROM.11.t:0 "Successfully brought the party together."
 SSW_ROM.11.d:0 "After a few days of negotiations, Gheorghe Bratianu, the head of the The Old School, agreed to reestablish the FRN. With the inclusion of the Old School, the reunion became more certain."

 SSW_ROM.12.a:0 "Get rid of them!"
 SSW_ROM.13.t:0 "Negotiating with the military"
 SSW_ROM.13.d:0 "In the past, the FRN had a paramilitary organization. This time, it is necessary to cooperate with the military to increase the political power of the FRN even more than before. Also, there are many royalists in the military, so it should be relatively easy to get their cooperation."
 SSW_ROM.13.a:0 "We need to work with the military."
 SSW_ROM.14.t:0 "Successfully brought the military together."
 SSW_ROM.14.d:0 "We have succeeded in getting the cooperation of the military as we had planned. The FRN will be a stronger organization than last time."

 SSW_ROM.15.t:0 "Failed to bring the military together."
 SSW_ROM.15.d:0 "The military refused to cooperate with us. But we will be able to do without them, just as we did last time."
 SSW_ROM.15.a:0 "Too bad."
 SSW_ROM.16.t:0 "Negotiations with the Peasants' Party"
 SSW_ROM.16.d:0 "If we can get the cooperation of our biggest rival, and one of the most legitimate in the country, the National Peasant Party, the FRN will be a very powerful organization. It may be difficult, but it will be worth a try."
 SSW_ROM.16.a:0 "Political divisions must be avoided."
 SSW_ROM.17.t:0 "Successfully negotiated with the Farmer's Party."

 SSW_ROM.17.a:0 "Very Well."
 SSW_ROM.18.t:0 "Failure to negotiate with the Farmers Party"
 SSW_ROM.18.d:0 "We and PNT finally broke down. They have requested some changes, which have been an uncompromising part for us. Of course, cooperation with them was difficult, but this made political division inevitable."
 SSW_ROM.18.a:0 "Get rid of them!"
 SSW_ROM.19.t:0 "Establishment of the National Renaissance Front"
 SSW_ROM.19.d:0 "After negotiations, Prime Minister Tatalesk succeeded in rebuilding the most ideal National Revival Front in the most peaceful way."
 SSW_ROM.19.a:0 "We did it!"
 SSW_ROM.20.t:0 "Proposal from the National Peasants' Party"
 SSW_ROM.20.d:0 "Just the other day, I received some proposals regarding FRN from PNT, whose negotiations broke down. If we accept this, FRN will be revived in a way that is very different from what we are facing. But getting the cooperation of the Farmers' Party may be even more appealing. What should we do with this?"
 SSW_ROM.20.a:0 "It's an acceptable proposal."
 SSW_ROM.20.b:0 "This cannot be compromised"
 SSW_ROM.21.t:0 "Trial of Iași"
 SSW_ROM.21.d:0 "At the Romanian city of Iași, those who led Romania to the Balkan war and their supporters were put on trial. Some men, officers who fought on the front lines and those in the military, were pardoned by the king and escaped punishment, but the majority was still executed or sentenced to life in prison. And so the trial came to an end. However, there are still rumors that collaborators are hiding in the underground and government circles."
 SSW_ROM.21.a:0 "They deserve it."
 SSW_ROM.22.t:0 "Remnants of the Iron Guard?"
 SSW_ROM.22.d:0 "One of the current ministers is believed to be a remnant of the Iron Guard. What should we do with him...?"
 SSW_ROM.22.a:0 "He should not be arrested."
 SSW_ROM.22.b:0 "They cannot be overlooked. Even a scholar is not except."
 SSW_ROM.23.t:0 "Iuliu Maniu Passed Away"
 SSW_ROM.23.d:0 "In 1918, Juliu Maniu, the great statesman who led Transylvania under the Habsburg Empire and created Greater Romania, passed away. The funeral was a national event, attended by prominent figures from all walks of life and local aspirants. In addition, the PNT will hold elections for the next party leader."
 SSW_ROM.23.a:0 "Odihneasca-se in pace."
 SSW_ROM.24.t:0 "Successor Election"
 SSW_ROM.24.d:0 "After the death of Iuliu Maniu, an election was held for his successor to determine the new head of the PNT. The two candidates were Ion Mihalache, who founded what is now the PNT with Iuliu Maniu, and Iuliu Maniu's nephew, Ionel Pop."
 SSW_ROM.24.a:0 "Ion Mihalache, prominent member of the National Peasants' Party wins"
 SSW_ROM.24.b:0 "Nephew of Iuliu Maniu, Ionel Pop wins"
 SSW_ROM.25.t:0 "Debate over the Agrarian Reform"
 SSW_ROM.25.d:0 "The agrarian reform is the eternal issue of the agrarian country of Romania. In 1921, after the great war, a large reform was conducted. However, this was an incomplete one and increased poverty. Now that the National Peasants' Party has taken the government, it will be easy to path a new reform. However, it may be important to debate this issue with the opposition party and find a compromise between them."
 SSW_ROM.25.a:0 "We have the majority, force the vote."
 SSW_ROM.25.b:0 "Compromise is necessary."
 SSW_ROM.26.t:0 "Forced vote on agrarian reform"
 SSW_ROM.26.d:0 "Succeeded in forcing a vote on this bill."
 SSW_ROM.26.a:0 "Wonderful."
 SSW_ROM.27.t:0 "Secret Treaty"
 SSW_ROM.27.d:0 "Just the other day, we were approached by the small Balkan country of Romania, who wanted to establish a cooperative relationship with us. Due to the Balkan War, Romania is the only democratic country in continental Europe. Should we protect them?"
 SSW_ROM.27.a:0 "Yes, we shall."
 SSW_ROM.27.b:0 "We have no interest in the Balkans."
 SSW_ROM.28.t:0 "Cooperation with Romania"
 SSW_ROM.28.d:0 "Romania has offered to cooperate and fight alongside us. Should we accept this offer?"
 SSW_ROM.28.a:0 "Yes, we shall."
 SSW_ROM.28.b:0 "We have no interest in the Balkans."
 SSW_ROM.29.t:0 "Form the Eastern European Alliance"
 SSW_ROM.29.d:0 "It is hereby affirmed that a strong alliance will be declared between Russia and Romania. Hitherto we have been mere neighbors, but now we are powerful friends."
 SSW_ROM.29.a:0 "This is our answer!"
 SSW_ROM.30.t:0 "Accept the fascists?"
 SSW_ROM.30.d:0 "In allying with Italy, we must change our attitude toward the fascists at home. Their repression must cease from this time forward."
 SSW_ROM.30.a:0 "It's the only way to cooperate."
 SSW_ROM.30.b:0 "That is the line you cannot cross."
 SSW_ROM.31.t:0 "Victory in the Balkan War"
 SSW_ROM.31.d:0 "After 1940, the military was nothing but a usurper. After 1940, the military had been nothing more than a usurper; it had participated in World War II as an Axis power and won, but lost the land. But it would have been enough to clear the stigma. That's what this cheer proves. Romania will continue to move forward under the principles of its hero, Marshal Antonescu."
 SSW_ROM.31.a:0 "Trăiască căpitanul!"
 SSW_ROM.31.b:0 "Dedicate the victory to Antonescu!"
 SSW_ROM.32.t:0 "Reconciliation"
 SSW_ROM.32.d:0 "There are signs of reconciliation between the royal family and the military despite the acrimonious relation for a long time. Marshal Antonescu originally understood the monarchy and tried to preserve the political freedom of the kingdom. After the Balkan War, there has been a resurgence in the defense of Romania's constitutional monarchy, following his legacy. The day will soon come when the military will withdraw from the political arena and the Kingdom of Romania will return."
 SSW_ROM.32.a:0 "Let us take hands for the future of our Kingdom."
 SSW_ROM.33.t:0 "Negotiate with Bulgaria"
 SSW_ROM.33.d:0 "In this war, Romania has gained a new major city in Bulgaria, Varna. Although the land was once claimed by Romania before the Balkan Wars, the majority of the inhabitants are Bulgarians, and there is a great deal of local opposition. Even though they were enemies, there is little disagreement between them. Could the exchange of land and the strengthening of political ties improve relations?"
 SSW_ROM.33.a:0 "Let us return the rightful land to the rightful owner."
 SSW_ROM.33.b:0 "Strengthen only political ties"
 SSW_ROM.34.t:0 "Negotiate with the Rival"
 SSW_ROM.34.d:0 "Romania and Hungary have been enemies for over a thousand years, and we have defeated them twice, once in 1919 and again this time. They are now under our control, and we can negotiate with them from a position of overwhelming superiority. They seem to want to be free even though they are defeated, so what should we do?"
 SSW_ROM.34.a:0 "Strengthen only political ties"
 SSW_ROM.35.t:0 "Maneuvers in Transylvania"
 SSW_ROM.35.d:0 "The Romanian Army and Air Force conducted a major joint exercise in the cities of Northern Transylvania. We, the liberating army, entered North Transylvania, which had been Hungarian territory since the Vienna Accord, and showed the Romanian people the strength of this army."
 SSW_ROM.35.a:0 "Transylvania, we have returned!"
 SSW_ROM.36.t:0 "Territorial Disputes"
 SSW_ROM.36.d:0 "The territorial dispute between Romania and Hungary is nothing new, but this war has created a new problem. In the area of the Hungarian Great Plains east of the Tisza River that we acquired, the majority of the inhabitants are of course Hungarians. It is said that some radicals in the country consider this area as a historical region based on the time of Dacia...\nEither way, there are still Hungarians living in the area, and there have been a number of attacks on soldiers stationed in the area by local residents, so ruling the area could be a burden for Romania. On the other hand, the return of the region could lead to a resurgence in Hungary. We need to choose our next course of action carefully."
 SSW_ROM.36.a:0 "Smaller the Better."
 SSW_ROM.36.b:0 "Let us return the rightful land to the rightful owner."
 SSW_ROM.37.t:0 "March on"
 SSW_ROM.37.d:0 "According to Corneliu Codreanu, founder of the Legion of Archangel Michael and our leader, we have always marched on because it was the best thing to do as citizens. From the time we gathered under the Capitán, to the time we pointed our guns at our enemies in revenge, we've always gone forward with noble ideals. And now that we've won, there's no one to stand in our way. Let us march, let us march! For we are the messengers of the great Archangel Michael!"
 SSW_ROM.37.a:0 "The Iron Guard is Archangel Michael's messenger!"
 SSW_ROM.38.t:0 "Revolutionary Guard"
 SSW_ROM.38.d:0 "With the stabilization of the political situation in the country after the end of the Balkan War, there's a growing movement in the parliament to exclude the Iron Guard. In response, its leader Horia Sima massively purged those who opposed him, and he declared a revolution. Some of his declarations seem to oppose the monarchy, and tensions are rising with the royal family. If the king were to go into exile again, or even be assassinated, chaos would be inevitable."
 SSW_ROM.38.a:0 "A country for Romanians must be formed."
 SSW_ROM.39.t:0 "Exile of King Mihai I"
 SSW_ROM.39.d:0 "Against the growing tensions between the Iron Guard and the royal family, King Mihai I finally left Romania for Switzerland in secret last night at the urging of the Marshal of the Court. The following day, a proclamation by the Iron Guard officially abolished the monarchy in Romania and brought the curtain down on the history of the Kingdom of Romania. While some people are disappointed with Mihai I's decision to go into exile in favor of his own safety, others claim that he has not yet left the throne."
 SSW_ROM.39.a:0 "German monarch, we banish thee!"
 SSW_ROM.40.t:0 "Assassination of King Mihai I"
 SSW_ROM.40.d:0 "Against the growing tensions between the Iron Guard and the royal family, King Mihai I, at the suggestion of the Marshal of the Court, planned to leave Romania for Switzerland in exile. Last night, it was finally done. However, on his way to the train, he was attacked by armed guards, who shot him four times and killed him and five of his aides. The next day, Horia Sima criticized the attack as being committed by radical partisans, yet formally declared the abolition of the monarchy."
 SSW_ROM.40.a:0 "Romanians do not need a German King!"
 SSW_ROM.41.t:0 "Negotiate with Hungary"
 SSW_ROM.41.d:0 "The Great Alföld Plain east of the Tisa River, acquired after the war, is an economically and culturally important region for Hungary, which is demanding its return. Also, our leader Horia Sima doesn't seem to be interested in non-Romanian land. We may be historical enemies, but some (if not all) of our interests may align."
 SSW_ROM.41.a:0 "We don't need the land of Magyars."
 SSW_ROM.42.t:0 "Negotiate with Bulgaria"
 SSW_ROM.42.d:0 "Romania and Bulgaria fought against each other in the war, but there is little reason for conflict between them. If we want the Bulgarians to be a good neighbor of ours, we'll need to adopt a friendly attitude towards them. However, is it really necessary for us to go that far?"
 SSW_ROM.42.a:0 "We should build a friendly relationship"
 SSW_ROM.42.b:0 "We think nothing of them"
 SSW_ROM.43.t:0 "Timisoara Conference"
 SSW_ROM.43.d:0 "Today, the Serbian Prime Minister and his cabinet will meet in Timisoara with Romanian leader Horia Sima and Iron Guard executives. They will discuss the relationship between Serbia and Romania after the Balkan War, hopefully leading to a further strengthening of diplomatic relations between the two countries."
 SSW_ROM.43.a:0 "Discuss with them."
 SSW_ROM.44.t:0 "The issue of Banat"
 SSW_ROM.44.d:0 "West Banat, owned by Serbia, is a territory that should've been ruled by Romania. Due to the harmful effects of British diplomacy towards the two nations after World War I, it became Serbian territory as a result. Historically many Romanians once lived there, and some of them still do. Conversely, most of its inhabitants are Slavic. We have little reason to occupy this area, but there are many who call for West Banat to be integrated into Banat proper. What should we do in regards to this land?"
 SSW_ROM.44.a:0 "It should be integrated into Greater Romania"
 SSW_ROM.44.b:0 "Serbian land for the Serbians"
 SSW_ROM.45.t:0 "The issue of Romanian residents in Serbia"
 SSW_ROM.45.d:0 "Nearly 60000 Romanians live in Serbian-controlled West Banat, while East Serbia houses a large Wallachian community, our close kin. As an organization made for all Romanians, shouldn't the Iron Guard, meaning us, have an obligation to improve their conditions?"
 SSW_ROM.45.a:0 "Ask the Serbian government for more autonomy"
 SSW_ROM.45.b:0 "It's not our problem"
 SSW_ROM.46.t:0 "Domestic Romanian Problem"
 SSW_ROM.46.d:0 "During a meeting with Romania, it was requested of us to improve the rights of Romanians within our country. This is a serious case of meddling in our internal affairs, so we don't have to accept, but if we still want friendly relations, we should do it."
 SSW_ROM.46.a:0 "Let's promise more autonomy"
 SSW_ROM.46.b:0 "It's an internal affair!"
 SSW_ROM.47.t:0 "Promise Romanian Autonomy"
 SSW_ROM.47.d:0 "The Serbians said they will deal with Romanians in their country in earnest and, even if they can't right now, have promised to gradually grant them more autonomy. We could say that the Timisoara Conference played a good role in reaffirming friendly relations between us, as we were able to have satisfying discussions on other issues as well."
 SSW_ROM.47.a:0 "We can maintain a good relation."
 SSW_ROM.48.t:0 "Demand Denied"
 SSW_ROM.48.d:0 "The Serbians rejected our request, arguing that it was domestic intervention. Our leader Horia Sima was furious upon hearing this, and after going on and on insulting them, left the meeting hall. Naturally, the Timisoara Conference ended on the spot,  completely destroying our friendly relations as a result, rather than building them up."
 SSW_ROM.48.a:0 "They are the enemy of the Romanian people!"
 SSW_ROM.49.t:0 "Romania invites us to their faction"
 SSW_ROM.49.d:0 "Romania has invited us to join the Balkan Alliance as a member of the Mutual Defense Community. Should we join?"
 SSW_ROM.49.a:0 "We should join"
 SSW_ROM.49.b:0 "We cannot trust such an organization!"
 SSW_ROM.50.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] accepts the invite"
 SSW_ROM.50.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] responded positively to our request. This will have a positive impact not only on both of our countries, but on the Balkan peninsula as well, contributing to the stability of the whole region. This is a momentous occasion."
 SSW_ROM.50.a:0 "May our alliance last forever!"
 SSW_ROM.51.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] rejects our invitation"
 SSW_ROM.51.d:0 "Recklessly, [FROM.GetName] has given us a foolish answer: they refused, after all. Experts around the world will blame this stupid act on them, as we of course do."
 SSW_ROM.51.a:0 "Truly a disappointment."

Romania and Russia have declared themselves allied, establishing the Eastern European League. This faction has only one goal: the destruction of their common enemies. The entire world was confused: the screams of Japanese housewives near a radio at the time echoed throughout the country, pasta spilled from forks all over Italy, and in Germany an overjoyed underground organization unintentionally showed itself, causing a mass arrest. Anyway, as a last remark, this crazy alliance is sadly real."

 SSW_ROM.52.d:0 "After the assassination attempt on Marshal Antonescu, it's time to formally decide on General Sanatescu's replacement. The most promising ones are General Gheorghe Mihail, who has the same military rank as Sanatescu, and the incumbent General himself. There's also Mr. Mihai Antonescu, supported by the opposition. With each faction's expectations mixed in, this election is expected to be extremely fierce. Who will be our next leader?"

 SSW_ROM.53.a:0 "We need their strength"
 SSW_ROM.54.t:0 "Ally Romania?"
 SSW_ROM.54.d:0 "The Romanian Foreign Minister has visited Berlin, and proposed a revival of our former alliance. Romania, having problems easily with its neighbors, may find itself into an undesired war. We need to carefully make a decision."

 SSW_ROM.55.a:0 "We did it!"
 SSW_ROM.56.t:0 "Failure of the negotiations"
 SSW_ROM.56.d:0 "Under Marshal Antonescu's regime, opposition is allowed to exist, and has sufficient influence on the people. As we seek to recapture Transylvania, which we lost after the war with Hungary, we must first get rid of the internal pains before the external ones. Negotiating with the opposition and getting them to understand our thinking would be the only surefire way to get rid of the first."
 SSW_ROM.56.a:0 "Let's begin"
 SSW_ROM.57.t:0 "The rebels' demands"
 SSW_ROM.57.d:0 "A three-way meeting was held between our national leaders, and those of the PNL and the PNT. The opposition's demands were generally the \"transformation\" of Antonescu's regime, with the most prominent ones being the keeping and improving political freedom and civilian control of the government. On the other hand, the military demanded that the opposition harmonize with the imminent Hungarian war, and cooperate politically until its end by seeking domestic stability. The demands were not contradictory of each other and, as a result, a three-way alliance will exist until the war against Hungary ends. This avoided the political division that concerned the military. The sound of marching boots is just around the corner."

 SSW_ROM.1.d:0 "Gunshots echoed in the square, drowning out the Marshal's voice: Ion Antonescu was shot at in the middle of his speech. The criminal yelled \"I did it!\" and committed suicide shortly after, his motive remaining unknown. After a difficult treatment, Antoniescu survived, but it's impossible for him to carry out his duties as he did before. What is the fate of Romania, now that its overwhelming leader is gone..."
 SSW_ROM.2.d:0 "An election will be held to decide on Marshal Antonescu's replacement. While Ion Gigurtu, who was Prime Minister before Antonescu took power, has been named as the most promising candidate, General Constantin Sanatescu, a powerful figure within the army, is also seen as a possible successor.\n\nThe outcome of this election will decide Romania's future..."
 SSW_ROM.3.d:0 "During Romanianization, committee members have noticed that, instead of Jewish companies, it's the German ones that still have a big presence within our country. If we ignore their interests and force Romanianization on them, the worsening of relations with Germany is inevitable. Even if we can't stop this movement, we may be able to intervene and order some restraint."

The central part of the city is in an uproar, with access being restricted near the port where the weapons are. It seems that the unexploded bombs, found 24 hours before, have not yet been neutralized."

 SSW_ROM.61.d:0 "The chimneys of Timisoara's factories have not put out smoke for several days.

 SSW_ROM.63.t:0 "Reopening of the Baneasa Race Track"
 SSW_ROM.63.d:0 "Horse racing in Romania has always been popular amongst the royalty and the public as a \"kingly sport\" ever since its inception. However, the last World War has put it in a difficult spot, with the requisition of racehorses, soaring feed prices due to food shortages, etc. Although the training and breeding of new horses continued, their quality inevitably declined. Even after the war, it was difficult to hold competitions due to domestic instability, and no matches have been held since. In light of the recent situation, where political stability has been restored and the economy is gradually recovering, the Romanian Jockey Club has insisted on resuming competitions, asking the state to finance the rebuilding of stables and to return jockeys drafted into the military. Reviving the Romanian horse-racing industry could result not only in better racehorses, but also in better war-horses. However, for that purpose, large amount of funds are needed, with some senior politicians saying that if this is an excuse to strengthen the army, we should refuse outright. Should we accept the Jockey Club's request?"
 SSW_ROM.63.a:0 "Time to restart the industry!"

Nearly 50,000 spectators had gathered to watch the battle to determine which of the three-year-old horses competing was the fastest. Epigon, with Romania's top jockey Aristide Cucu on the saddle, received a lot of attention, winning the derby as if to respond to this popularity. It was a long-sought victory for Cucu, and a memorable day in the history of Romanian horse racing."

Starting from race-horses, our past knowledge on the subject has been brought back, and the animals' pedigree has been reviewed. As a result, the new horses' abilities have improved significantly compared to the previous year's. The unnecessary fixation on horse racing by the upper classes has been completely dispelled and, consequently, some military personnel said that the new war horses have strengthened the army."
 SSW_ROM.65.a:0 "Well done"
 SSW_ROM.4.d:0 "Army exercises were held in Timisoara in preparation of a war with Hungary. Despite the impending crisis, the soldiers showed high morale during both their training and the exercise.

Said country seemed to be becoming increasingly more nationalist, with voices calling for “settling the score” with brute force against Hungary being the new majority. Upon his return, Sima immediately gathered Iron Guard members from all over the country and marched to Bucharest, demanding the resignation of the government.
