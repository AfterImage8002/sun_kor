Naturally, Japan does not recognize the independence of the Republic of Siberia. Within Japan, hard-line arguments such as the need to start a war and the need to have it firmly rooted in the West are being voiced. However, the Japanese military is not ready to go to war against Siberia, and the Japanese government has not been able to take measures to use force."
