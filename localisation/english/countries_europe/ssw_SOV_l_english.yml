 SOV_KLIMENT_VOROSHILOV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn: §WFebruary 4, 1881 in Verkhneye, Bakhmut uyezd, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career: §WKliment Efremovich Voroshilov was born in Ukraine to a family of railroad workers. Joining the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1905, he became a member of the NKVD within the Ukrainian People's Commissariat during the Russian Revolution, meeting Stalin around this time. He commanded the Petrograd police after the Soviet-Polish War. After the defeat of the White Army, he became a Politburo member and, with Michail Frunze's death in 1925, was made Chairman of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, helping to move military industry to the East. After being appointed People's Commissar for Defense in 1934, he became one of the first Marshals of the Soviet Union in 1935. During Stalin's Great Purge, he assisted him in accusing many of his peers, including Marshal Tukhachevsky. After this, he promoted reform within the Red Army, but didn't receive much support.\nDuring the Winter War, one of his plans failed and, after being criticized for this, was replaced by Semyon Timoshenko as People's Commissar for Defense. He commanded the invasion of Poland. After the Great Patriotic War began, he became commander of the Northwestern Front, defending against the Germans but never countering them. He resigned as a way to take responsibility for the siege of Leningrad, but stayed in the Red Army due to his political influence. Although he was in the reserves for a while, he attended and signed the peace treaty with Germany as a USSR representative. After that, he was relegated to the Siberian Front.\n§YImportant Notes: §Walthough his fame as a commander is fading away, he's still a powerful Political Commissar.§!§!§!§!§!§!"
 SOV_SEMYON_BUDYONNY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn: §WApril 25, 1883 in Platovskaya, Kalmytsky district, Don Host Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career: §Wborn a farmer, Semyon Michailovich Budyonny joined the Primorsky Dragoon Regiment in 1903, participating in the Russo-Japanese War the following year. After that, he graduated from cavalry school. He bravely fought against the Central Powers during World War I and received honors for it, including the Order of St.George Cross.\n\nWhen the Russian Revolution broke out, he sided with the Bolsheviks, like many others. At this time, he led a cavalry unit against the Don Cossacks. The \"Budyonny Cavalry\" was a cause of concern for the White Army, overwhelming both Wrangel and Denikin. After the end of the civil war, he worked on breeding horses and was listed among the first \"Marshals of the Soviet Union\", the greatest commanders of the Red Army. He avoided Stalin's Great Purge and was appointed head of the Moscow Military District. He was also People's Deputy Commissar for Defense.\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War, beginning in 1941, he still led cavalry and kept getting defeated by  mechanized units, revealing his incompetence in modern warfare, although he wasn't reprimanded for this. Repeatedly withdrawing towards the Caucasus, he was spurned by Konev and others, but Stalin still didn't punish him (as they were actually friends). After peace returned, he became Marshal of the Red Army Cavalry, but due to the reduction of their numbers, his duties and rank meant little.\n§YImportant Notes: §Whis knowledge in modern warfare is shallow, and can hardly be considered a proper commander.§!§!§!§!§!§!"
 SOV_GRIGORY_KULIK_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn: §WNovember 9, 1890 in Dudnikovo, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career: §WGrigory Ivanovich Kulik, Ukrainian farmer, was first recruited by the Russian Imperial Army in 1917, serving in World War I. After getting artillery expertise there, he joined the Red Army at the start of the Russian Civil War under Voroshilov's recommendation, leading an artillery detachment to Budyonny. He didn't play any major role in the Battle of Tsaritzin, but became friends with Stalin.\n\nShortly after, he became an artillery commander. He was dispatched as a military advisor in the Spanish Civil War, on the Republican side, being involved with Tukhachevsky's demise at the same time. He also rebuked the Red Napoleon's idea of propelled artillery; he stuck to cannons, hated machine guns as policemen weapons, and described mine-laying as a \"tactic for the weak\". Still, the technological superiority of the Wehrmacht - which used all those armaments - would show itself during the Great Patriotic War. He led the invasion of Poland in 1939, and was listed as a Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1940. After the German declaration of war, he was assigned to the northwestern front, with Leningrad being besieged under his poor leadership. This had him demoted to Major General, but fortunately for him, his friendship with Stalin saved him from the firing squad. He was reassigned to the Caucasus after his court martial. After the fall of Stavropol, he withdrew north of Kalmykia and stayed there until the end of the war, which resulted in his shaky rehabilitation and re-promotion to Marshal. However, in the military, despised generals who are also incompetent are nicknamed \"Kuliks\".\n§YImportant Notes: §Wincompetent, but rational and humane.§!§!§!§!§!§!"
 SOV_IVAN_KONEV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn: §WDecember 28, 1897 in Lodeyno, Nikolsky uyezd, Vologda Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§W Born into a poor family, Ivan Stepanovich Konev began his career in the army when he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1916. After joining the Kerensky offensive in a heavy artillery unit, he joined the Red Army and Bolshevik and fought against the White Army. His life was spared during the Great Purge thanks to Voroshilov, his superior during the civil war.\n\nAfter suppressing the revolt of Kronstadt, he graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1926. He taught at the military academy and was later successfully promoted to the ranks of division commander, political commissar, and military commander. In the political sphere, he was endorsed into the Central Committee of the party. Unfortunately, the large-scale invasion by Germany into the Soviet Union occurred after this. \n\nWhen the war broke out, he was stationed in Belarus, joining the battle of Vitebsk, and Smolensk. However, the overwhelming German forces pushed him closer to Moscow, and he himself was responsible for the defense of the city of Kalinin. In addition, due to his comrade and superior, Zhukov, transferred to Siberia, and was charged with the defense of Moscow in general. \nThe defensive battle was mostly successful, but in the end, everything was destroyed in a raid by the German Luftwaffe, leading to the fall of Moscow and the capitulation of the Soviet Union. The leadership, including Stalin, attributed this failure to the Air Force Command, instead of him. This spared him from the punishment of demotion, arrest, and execution which Air Force officers faced. Despite this, the defeat was one of Konev's stigmata.\n§YImportant Notes:§W He is described as Zhukov's \"right hand man\".§!§!§!§!§!§!"

 SOV_GEORGY_ZHUKOV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\nBorn: §WDecember 1, 1896 in Maloyaroslavets, Kaluga Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career: §Wborn to a family of farmers and merchants, Georgy Konstantinovich Zhukov wasn't interested in politics in his youth. He trained in fur-making under a relative, learning German at this time. With the outbreak of World War I, he volunteered with his cousin and joined the army in 1915. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was born, and Zhukov chose to support the Bolsheviks. After being dispatched to fight Wrangel's army, he also played a role in suppressing of Antonov's rebellion.\n\nHe remained in the Red Army, working with cavalry after the post-war demobilization. He turned his unit into an elite force, and for this he was highly praised. After enrolling for the high-rank commander course at the Frunze Military Academy, he was kept in even higher regard by his superiors, which contributed to his rapid promotion.\nHe avoided the Great Purge partly thanks to his successful skirmish with the Kwantung Army, which was present Mongolia and gaining power at the time. Disgusted by Shtern and Kulik's intervention, he kept his command independent from theirs and won a big victory at Nomohan (Khalkhin). This resulted in him being appointed to the post of his superior, who fell victim of the purge.\n\nDuring the Great Patriotic War, he took up the duty of Chief of Staff and Commander for Europe. He thought of the Wehrmacht as \"incomparable to the Kwantung Army\", repeatedly defending and counterattacking, but allowing it access to Moscow. Conflicts with Stalin over Kiev made him leave the post of Chief of Staff, then attempting to stall German troops in Ukraine. As a result, he led the Red Army's first successful offensive, but was overwhelmed. As Khrushchev criticized him for this, Zhukov headed to Siberia to stop a massive IJA invasion.\nTaking the Japanese by surprise, he succeeded in suppressing them, making peace with the Empire possible. Still, he was too late to save the European front: Zhukov couldn't overcome the late-1943 offensive, which ushered in German-Soviet peace. After the war, he became commander of the Ural Military District, but his pre-war charisma was no longer there.\n§YImportant Notes: §Wa fairly capable commander, blocked by the shock of defeat.§!§!§!§!§!§!"

The People's United Front is made up of various factions, but one faction, called the Conversionists, advocates a fusion of nationalism and Bolshevikism, while the Eurasianists advocate the construction of a nationalist state that transcends the boundaries of nationalism that have been advocated so far.\n\nThere is still a lot of uncertainty as to which side will come to power, and the unexpected political situation has superpowers like Germany and Japan concerned."

With the mighty Soviet Union being overwhelmed by Hitler's Third Reich, the economic collapse, and the political turmoil, the people longed for a return to prominence: the Russian Empire, conqueror of vast lands, and Lenin's Soviet Union, leading the socialists of the world and challenging the global order.\n\nIn order to make their wish reality, the people rose up and succeeded in carrying out a coup. The new form the nation should take still unclear, they want to build a system transcending socialism and reactionarism.\n\nNow, by temporarily making Lev Gumilyov the head of state, a new form of government will be decided upon."

Life can't be stable without food."

 SOV_exploit:0 "Exploit"

 SOV_subsidies_ethnic_minority_desc:0 "In our country, which has many ethnic minorities, various ethnic groups were forcibly relocated during the Great Patriotic War and the Great Purge, and they suffered from harsh transportation and were tormented by starvation and disease due to the poor living conditions in the relocated areas. This suffering continues to this day, and many ethnic minorities are hoping for stability in their lives. For the sake of the unity of the various ethnic groups that Eurasianism stands for, we must provide them with subsidies and allow them to choose between encouraging them to return home and developing a new land."

By reviving the welfare system, we will be able to show our favor to the people and increase their support for us."
 SOV_vast_economic_cycle:0 "Expansive Economic Cycle"
 SOV_vast_economic_cycle_desc:0 "When the planned economy collapsed after the Great Patriotic War, unregulated traders and markets emerged, becoming part of the people's lives.

 SOV_economic_liberation:0 "Economic Liberation"
 SOV_economic_liberation_desc:0 "The Soviet-era planned economy not only put a burden on the people, but also exposed the inefficiency of huge administrations. From these reflection, we must eliminate as many economic constraints as we can, and build a free-market system.

 SOV_tax_exemption_military_industry:0 "Military Industry Tax Exemptions"
 SOV_tax_exemption_military_industry_desc:0 "The military industry is essential for conquest, one of Eurasia's greatest goals.

Therefore, tax exemptions on the military industry will ultimately yield enormous profits."

 SOV_relentless_pursuit:0 "Constant Pursuit"
 SOV_relentless_pursuit_desc:0 "As Gumilyov is a scholar, he's always interested in exploring his field of expertise.

 SOV_I_beg_differ:0 "No Objections"
 SOV_I_beg_differ_desc:0 "Those who oppose Gumilyov's perfect theories are, frankly, stupid. Opposers are an insult to the Eurasian peoples as well as pathetic criticisms born from Leninism.

 SOV_learn_two_disaster:0 "Learn from our Two Disasters"

It was only a few years ago that he was forced to work himself to death in concentration camps and fight on the front lines of a losing war. These events seem to have changed everything about Gumilyov's personality and ideology, and have influenced the way he runs the State of Eurasia."
 SOV_search_imaginary_kingdom:0 "Seach for the Mythical Kingdom"
 SOV_search_imaginary_kingdom_desc:0 "Because nomads live on the move, it is extremely difficult for them to preserve their heritage in the form of cities and documents.

It remains to be seen how this research will affect the ideology of Eurasianism."

 SOV_expand_from_discovery_desc:0 "As historical research in Central Asia progresses, more and more interesting artifacts are being discovered, and comparing these artifacts with ancient writings from China, Russia, and Persia brings us more mysteries and discoveries. In addition, a mural painting discovered at a site in central Kazakhstan depicts what appears to be an ancient Christian Nestorian cleric, and an ancient cross was found in a nearby village. This revealed the existence of the Eastern Christian nation of Prester John, a legendary figure in the Christian world!"
 SOV_focus_excavation:0 "Focus on Excavating"
 SOV_focus_excavation_desc:0 "The growing credibility of Prester John's kingdom has further increased the public's academic interest in Central Asia. This has prompted the government to update the equipment used for excavations to the latest models and to mobilize more scholars, regardless of their specialties, for excavations. The passion of the scholars will not stop until they know all about history."
 SOV_great_lecture:0 "Dissertation"
 SOV_great_lecture_desc:0 "Although Gumilyov is extremely busy with political leadership and historical research, he does not intend to make the title of Professor Emeritus of the Kazakh University a mere decoration. According to his wishes, he intends to return to teach at the Kazakh University, where he plans to teach the theories, he has developed to his students. It is unusual for the leader of a country to give a lecture, and there is some opposition within the government due to security concerns and other duties that are coming due, but it seems difficult to bend Gmilyov's will."
 SOV_only_geniuses:0 "Only Geniuses"
 SOV_only_geniuses_desc:0 "Giving out scholarships equally without carefully examining individual talents as in the past is a waste of money and will only increase the number of stupid students. Therefore, we should implement a study program that examines the talents of individuals more closely and change the system to provide large scholarships only to those with outstanding abilities. This policy will increase competition and produce a truly elite class."
 SOV_new_book:0 "A New Book"
 SOV_new_book_desc:0 "The \"Civilization and Passion in Modern Times,\" which Gumilyov completed in his spare time, needs to be read by every individual to recognize the situation of his own country and people.

 SOV_theoretical_development:0 "Develop our Theory"
 SOV_theoretical_development_desc:0 "Our Eurasianism has lacked ideological clarity, but through much debate and historical examination, the answer is finally being discovered.

 SOV_new_history_textbook_desc:0 "Since Gumilyov came to power, he has put a lot of effort into educational reform. But there was one area that had not yet been tackled: history, which was also Gumilyov's field of expertise. Now that we have a new national policy and an accurate view of history, we can finally start working on a new history textbook. With the new textbooks, children will be able to learn pride in the Eurasian cultural sphere and intense patriotism for their country."

Scholars from various fields have been gathered and new research is about to begin."
 SOV_eurasian_diplomacy:0 "Eurasian Diplomacy"
 SOV_eurasian_diplomacy_desc:0 "Due to our historical location between Europe and Asia, we have been influenced by both, becoming the site of many peculiar events. The Westernization policies began by Tsar Peter the Great led to Russia being considered a European state, but it wasn't so completely, as it retained a lot of Asian features. The debate over whether to see our nation as Asian or European was settled by defining it as \"Eurasian\". The three powers in Asia, Europe and Eurasia will be regarded as the main players in a continent-wide conflict in the future."

And yet, Germany is a far worse enemy, seeing us as an inferior race, so bloodshed will be inevitable. The conflict between the German-led West and Eurasia will be ethnically and geopolitically absolute; the people must be informed of their destiny and their hearts prepared."
 SOV_contact_compatriot:0 "Contact our Brethren"
 SOV_contact_compatriot_desc:0 "We selected Central Asia as Eurasia's first territorial reclamation. The people there have traditionally been our compatriots for years, and we have a common destiny.

 SOV_liberation_compatriot_desc:0 "Those who betrayed the will of the people and chose their stupid independence are incredibly ignorant and not qualified to be called \"leaders\".

 SOV_sworn_enemy_south_desc:0 "Excluding the West, another historical enemy of Eurasia exists: China. For thousands of years, their dynasties have fought with our ancestors, like the Xianyun, the Xiongnu, the Khitan, and the Mongols. Even after the decline of these nomadic tribes, border disputes occurred between them and the Russian Empire/Soviet Union. In this regard, China is an historical enemy, and the present is no exception. We must strengthen our military pressure on China and remind them of our might."

 SOV_super_ethnos_far_east_desc:0 "China, our enemy, has another troublesome foe besides us. Japan is the great power of the Far East, achieving rapid progress since the Meiji Restoration and winning numerous wars. Although their exact ethnic origins are unknown, there's a theory that they came from the Lake Baikal area of Siberia. We can see what they have in common with us. Moreover, their passionarity is high, the ultimate proof of this being their victory in World War II. An alliance with them should bring us many benefits."

 SOV_manchurian_allies:0 "Manchurian Allies"
 SOV_manchurian_allies_desc:0 "The fact that Japan invaded Manchuria and founded Manchukuo gave hope to some of the ethnic minorities trying to escape Han rule, but that was shattered under the Mantetsu and the Kwantung Army.

His congratulatory speech was made very passionate by his excitement and expectations, but the guests' reactions were mixed: some listened in and applauded him, while others drank liquor, ate food, and simply enjoyed the party.

Furthermore, it has been reported that some Red Army units have broken off from the Chain of Command and are acting independently like some kind of warlord-wannabes.\n\nThis investigation was conducted through espionage, hearings, and information exchange with friendly militias, with sufficient intel being obtained.

 SOV_LEV_GUMILYOV_DESC:0 "Lev Nikolaevich Gumilyov was born from Russian poets Nikolay Gumilyov and Anna Akhmatova. However, his famous family turned out to be a curse for him.\n\nHis father was executed during the Russian Revolution on charges of conspiracy, while his mother was kept under NKVD surveillance for her works on family love and individualism, seen as counter-revolutionary by the communist-aligned Soviet administration.\n\nEven in such an environment, Gumilyov devoted himself to studying history, archeology, geology, and literature. In the 1930s, he was part of a research expedition to Central Asia and, in 1934, he entered the University of Leningrad.\n\nHowever, when Stalin's Great Purge began, Gumilyov was arrested in 1938 on suspicions of organizing a counter-revolutionary group, and sentenced to imprisonment. After that, he saw many die cruel deaths in the Gulags. During his time there, the intellectual Gumilyov observed the prisoners' behavior from a sociological perspective, becoming aware of the interaction between natural environment and society.\n\nIn 1943, his imprisonment sentence was commuted when he enrolled in the army, fighting against the overwhelming German Heer on the front. Seeing the Red Army suffering from enemy fire, hunger, and cold due to the lack of supplies, Gumilyov once again observed the link between nature and society, refining his theory.\n\nAfter the war, Gumilyov entered Kazan University, where he met Pyotr Savitsky, a former White Russian who fled the Nazis and returned to the USSR, who taught him about Eurasianism. The two along well, attracting a lot of attention in the chaotic post-war Union. However, this wasn't welcomed by Soviet authorities and, although his research was obstructed and he was arrested many times, they couln't eliminate Gumilyov, who was becoming more and more popular with Soviet power weakining. Finally, amidst the turmoil of the power struggle after Stalin's death, the Eurasianists launched a successful coup.\n\nThis young scholar has pledged allegiance to neither Russia nor the Soviet Union, only faithful to the concept of Eurasia. Only time will tell whether he will overcome the Eastern and Western threats by using the passion of the people (Passionar Nosti), and build the Eurasian nation of his dreams..."

Can Germany drive the Communists back to the frigid lands of Siberia?"

The balance that Stalin had barely maintained collapsed after his death, and the fierce power struggle that had been going on seems to have come to an end.\nAt one time a troika system against the reformists seemed to have been established, but it collapsed due to Kaganovich's plot, Malenkov and Saburov, who constituted the troika system, were executed, and the Soviet Union is once again embroiled in the ravages of the purges."

The balance Stalin had managed to barely maintain collapsed after his death, and the subsequent, fierce power struggle that had been going on seems to have come to an end.\nMalenkov stopped the rise of the Reformists by forming a Troika (Triumvirate), thus dealing with the remaining two contenders for leadership: Kaganovich's plot was thwarted, while the Technocrats lost their influence with Saburov's demotion.\nIn return, Malenkov gained Suslov and Voroshilov as loyal subordinates, and many expect he will lead the Soviet Union towards a collective leadership system different from that of the Stalin era."

The Technocrats took advantage of this to ally with the Reformists, making rapid progress in the struggle and allowing Saburov to seize power.\nWith the Technocrats ruling over the country, heavy industry in the Soviet Union will grow even more, but this will also lead to more worker exploitation."
