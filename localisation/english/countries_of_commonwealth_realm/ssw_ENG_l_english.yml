 SSW_ENG.1.t:0 "The Beacon of Change"
 SSW_ENG.1.d:0 "Next year will mark the 100th anniversary of the 1851 London Great Exhibition. To commemorate this milestone, the Labour government has decided to hold a so-called \"Festival of Britain\". The United Kingdom is undergoing a period of great internal change, as it is moving from an Empire towards a \"Commonwealth of Nations\". The Festival of Britain will be a grand event, serving as a \"beacon of change\" for the entire nation."
 SSW_ENG.1.a:0 "Or let's make it the \"Cornerstone of Rebirth\" of Great Britain."
 SSW_ENG.2.t:0 "Appoint a Festival Director"
 SSW_ENG.2.d:0 "The London Great Exhibition was held in 1851 and, as next year marks its 100th anniversary, we'll celebrate by holding a Festival of Britain. There are two candidates for the position of Festival Director, but which one should we choose...?"
 SSW_ENG.2.a:0 "Herbert Morrison would be the right choice"
 SSW_ENG.3.t:0 "Clement Attlee's bribery scandal"
 SSW_ENG.3.d:0 "The issue of Clement Attlee's bribery scandal was pursued by Conservative Party members at a recent session of the House of Commons. The issue quickly became the target of the mass media..."
 SSW_ENG.3.a:0 "The Labour government will collapse soon..."
 SSW_ENG.4.t:0 "Clement Attlee announces resignation"
 SSW_ENG.4.d:0 "The other day, Clement Attlee's money transfers became the subject of an inquiry by Conservative Party members in the House of Commons, spelling trouble for the Labour leader. As a response, Attlee announced his stepping down from party leadership. Many expect that Labour Party key figure, Herbert Morrison, will be chosen to succeed him."
 SSW_ENG.4.a:0 "Will Morrison be able to keep the Labour Party in power?"
 SSW_ENG.5.t:0 "To the House of Commons' dissolution"
 SSW_ENG.5.d:0 "In response to Attlee's money transfers, a Conservative Party member submitted a vote of no confidence towards the Cabinet, which passed the other day. The Second Attlee Cabinet declared in turn the dissolution of the House of Commons."
 SSW_ENG.5.a:0 "Get ready for the elections!"
 SSW_ENG.6.t:0 "The Conservative Party announces a primary"
 SSW_ENG.6.d:0 "In order to give the Conservatives a better chance in the upcoming elections, their first opportunity to regain power after losing it to Labour, leader Robert Gascoyne-Cecil announced his resignation, opening a way to a party primary to elect his successor.\nThe most likely to be chosen is either former General Winston Churchill, who dreams of reviving the British Empire, or the One-nation conservative Harold Macmillan."
 SSW_ENG.6.a:0 "This shall be the fiercest battle in Conservative history!"
 SSW_ENG.7.t:0 "Conservative Party Leader elections"
 SSW_ENG.7.d:0 "The hottest topic in the country right now is the election for Conservative Party leader. It's no exaggeration to say that this election has given the party the most attention since its formation.\nThose running are Winston Churchill, who envisions the return of the British Empire, and One-nation conservative Harold Macmillan. The future of [ENG.GetNameDef] will depend upon this result."
 SSW_ENG.7.a:0 "Churchill for party leader! Rule Britannia!"
 SSW_ENG.8.t:0 "Preparations for the Festival are Underway"
 SSW_ENG.8.d:0 "Herbert Morrison was chosen as the Director responsible for the Festival of Britain, scheduled for the summer of 1951, and preparations are procceding smoothly."
 SSW_ENG.8.a:0 "We are relieved for now."
 SSW_ENG.9.t:0 "Increased support for Oswald Mosley"
 SSW_ENG.9.d:0 "The two major political parties of [ENG.GetNameDef], Conservatives and Labour, have been declining in recent years. The former became an opposition party after peace was signed, and the latter caused an economic recession due to the failure of their high-welfare, high-tax \"from the cradle to the grave\" policy.\nMeanwhile, there has been another one that rapidly expanded its support and rose as a third candidate for ruling party. If they gain any more momentum, there's a good chance they will cause a hung parliament."
 SSW_ENG.9.a:0 "It's clear who will take power if that happens."
 SSW_ENG.10.t:0 "The German Threat"
 SSW_ENG.10.d:0 "World War II, caused by Germany challenging the old world order, ended with our defeat. The threat said nation poses is still very much alive, just across the Strait of Dover. [ENG.GetLeader] has declared his \"readiness to work with other European forces to counter their power\"."
 SSW_ENG.10.a:0 "The birth of a united Europe must be prevented"
 SSW_ENG.11.t:0 "Franco-British Talks"
 SSW_ENG.11.d:0 "[ENG.GetLeader] has just made a surprising visit to the [FRA.GetName]. [FRA.GetLeader] welcomed the British Prime Minister despite the short notice, warming up relations between Britain and France, despite their bond lying broken for more than 10 years by the now-faded German influence on the [FRA.GetName]."
 SSW_ENG.11.a:0 "Marvelous!"
 SSW_ENG.12.t:0 "[ENG.GetNameDef] recognizes [FRA.GetNameDef]"
 SSW_ENG.12.d:0 "The French post-war government, reformed by Philippe Pétain and under German influence, hadn't been recognized by the United Kingdom. However, with the Reich's diplomatic sway now gone, British politicians have thought it wise to officially recognize [FRA.GetNameDef] as the legitimate government of France, re-establishing cooperation in order to contain Germany."
 SSW_ENG.12.a:0 "A toast, to renewed Franco-British relations!"

 SSW_ENG.23.d:0 "Conflict between the factions of Gaitskell and Bevan, both influential, is now in full swing within the Labour Party, splitting it in two. This struggle was worsened by the party leadership election following Clement Attlee's resignation.\nThe current Labour secretary Morrison was part of the more conservative faction when he ran for leadership, but many expected him to mediate to suppres the dispute. He instead focused on trying to gather support among the middle class, launching many Gaitskellist policies to appeal to supporters of the Liberal Party.\nIn addition to a great deal of criticism from the working class, Morrison's move was met with fierce opposition by Aneurin Bevan and other leftists.\nThe Liberal Party now has its lowest numer of parliament seats ever, losing many constituencies to Labour, and its survival is in danger. In this context, Deputy Prime Minister Gaitskell recently released a statement saying that \"there's room to compromise with the Liberals. We have many policies in common.\" Prime Minister Morrison also agrees with this. What will be the fate of the two parties?"
 SSW_ENG.23.a:0 "Bevan won't shut his mouth"
 SSW_ENG.24.d:0 "The day when the Liberal Party will cease to exist is fast approaching. Labour leader Herbert Morrison, who recently said he was willing to merge with the Liberals, met with Clement Davis, their leader. The two parties, having much in common in terms of economic and foreign policy, have have taken a big step towards merging. \nAfter the meeting, Morrison said that it \"turned out great. Many constructive discussions took place and a consensus was reached. It was a historic meeting that will help us build the Great Britain we envision.\" Davis wrote: \"I have been able to determine they are worthy of continuing the proud tradition and honor my party has built up.\"\nHowever, the Labour leftists criticized the event as \"a disgrace to the party\", with many MPs suggesting they would leave if a merger took place. Leftist faction leader Bevan said: \"The Labour Party should be for the workers and, if it fails to do its job, we should consider taking appropriate action.\""
 SSW_ENG.24.a:0 "The Liberals, or the leftists?"
 SSW_ENG.25.d:0 "Bevan and Prime Minister Morrison met yesterday in Birmingham: in order to prevent the Conservatives from replacing the government, the leftist faction has stated it will support the Prime Minister until the next general election.\nThe Labour Party was divided by Morrison's steps to merge with the Liberals, but losing power to the Conservatives was worse to them than supporting the Prime Minister.\nBevan stated that \"having a general election or a change of government would be a huge burden on the people and bad for Britain. We shouldn't be selfish here.\" The Conservative Party dismissed this series of events as \"a boring one-man show\"."

We have no historical precedent, let alone any real benefit, in merging with them. It's outrageous.\"\nDiscussions were extremely heated over the course of two weeks, with a wide variety of opinions.

This is a critical situation that requires cooperation within the party.\"\nBevan, the left-wing leader, stated: \"I am very honored.

Workers feel that, even though the war is over, they still have the same living standards as during it. Under such circumstances, the government cut back on social security.
