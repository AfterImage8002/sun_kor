 GER_josef_grohe_desc:0 "§gBorn the son of a peasant, Joseph Grohe was one of the earliest members to join the NSDAP shortly after World War I. Once the Nazis took control of the German government, he worked to consolidate their position of power in West Germany, leading such actions as the ouster of Konrad Adenauer. After the creation of the Rreichsgau, he was appointed gauleiter of the Reichstag of Cologne-Aachen, where he presided over the National Socialist leadership of the Ruhr industrial area. After the conquest of Belgium, he was appointed deputy national commissioner of the Reichskommissariat Bergien-Nordfrankreich, assisting General Alexander von Falkenhausen, who had been sent as military governor.§!"
 BNF_leon_degrelle_desc:0 "§gBelgian far-right activist Léon Joseph Marie Ignace Degrelle is the perfect collaborator for the German government. In the 1930s, he organized the Rexist Party as a rally point for the Belgian right-wing, gaining a good voter turnout in the pre-war elections. This meant nothing until the Germans came and, under the occupation, Degrelle cooperated with them with impressive vigor. When the German-Soviet War broke out, he left the Rexist Party to a subordinate and joined the SS as a volunteer, showing bravery on the Ukrainian front and winning the Iron Cross. After the war ended, he returned hom to once again lead his party, struggling to raise funds in order to keep it running after its steady expansion. Currently, his relationship with the Flemish nationalist organization VNF isn't positive, and ideological clashes are frequent.§!"
 BNF_hendrik_elias_desc:0 "§gHendrik Josef Elias was a scholar by nature and, after attending various universities, joined the Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (VNS) and entered politics. He admired Hitler and built a collaborationist network in Flanders after the German invasion of Belgium, but was still investigated by SS member Gottlob Berger for his opposition to integration into the Reich. He used the VNS to transport German POWs and gather volunteers for the Eastern Front and, just before the end of the war, continued to work with the Reich after some degree of autonomy was granted to Flanders. Currently, he doesn't get along with his Walloon counterpart Léon Degrelle, with several clashes occurring between their respective militias.§!"
 GER_richard_jungclaus_desc:0 "§gRichard Jungclaus, like many others, joined the NSDAP and the Sturmabteilung (SA) in the early 30s, switching to the Schutzstaffel (SS) Totenkopfverbände in 1941, working hard to manage the increasing number of POWs as the war progressed. For his efforts, he was promoted to Lieutenant-General and, in 1944, appointed chief of police of Reichskommissariat Belgien-Nordfrankreich, working hard to suppress the resistance there. He favors Wallon activist Léon Degrelle in his clashes against Flemish VNS leader Elias and nationalist Jef van de Wiele.§!"
 GER_alexander_von_falkenhausen_desc:0 "§gFreiherr Ernst Alexander Alfred Hermann von Falkenhausen is an inquisitive man, serving in China and Japan before World War I and, during the war, traveling across the Eastern and Western Fronts and serving as staff officer in many units. After meeting with General s Hans von Seeckt and Franz von Papen, Falkenhausen remained in the Weimar Republican Army. However, he was involved in an NSDAP-related incident and was forced to retire. After Hitler declared rearmament, he returned to the army and was dispatched to China as a military advisor in place of Seeckt, becoming friends with the Chinese military leadership, including Chiang Kai-shek. After returning to Germany, he was appointed Reichskommissar of Belgien-Nordfrankreich. However, based on past experiences, he's no longer comfortable with the NSDAP, intentionally interfering with the Fatherland's policies in the areas he presides over.§!"
