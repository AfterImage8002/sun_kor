 CZE_jaroslav_krejci_desc:0 "§gBefore the war, Jaroslav Krejci joined the Czechoslovak government as a low-profile bureaucrat, but rose through the ranks amidst the arrests and exile of politicians during the Munich Conference and the ensuing dissolution of Czechoslovakia, assuming the position of minister. In 1942, after the assassination of Prime Minister Alois Eliassi, President Emil Hacha appointed him Prime Minister, givign him most of the power of the protectorate-government.

 CZE_frantisek_chvalkovsky_desc:0 "§gvAfter the independence of Czechoslovakia, Frantisek Hvarkovsky worked as secretary to Prime Minister Antonín Švehla and later became a diplomat who traveled to several countries. However, this didn't last long and, when the Munich Conference decreed the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs and representative of the negotiations with Hungary, resulting in the ceding of the Slovak territory as per the Vienna award. After Slovakia became independent and the Czech Republic became a protectorate, he was removed from office when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was dismantled, but Germany appointed him special ambassador to the protectorate for his contributions to the Axis powers.§!"
 GER_walter_bertsch_desc:0 "§gWalter Bertsch, an unremarkable SS memeber, was appointed Minister of Economy and Labor with the establishment of the Reichsprotektorat Bohmen-Mähren. His mission is to \"Aryanize\" the economy, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done, like as using the Daluege's police to remove impurities.§!"
 GER_kurt_daluege_desc:0 "§gOriginally, Kurt Max Franz Daluge, who had risen to the position of Chief of the Odnungspolizei in Germany, was a member of the SA, but he defected to the SS, and even helped them to execute his former comrades in the Night of the Long knives. Within the SS, he even engaged in a minor power struggle against Himmler, eventually attaining the rank of senior general in the SS and police. As the resistance in the Bohmen region intensified, he was given the position of lieutenant governor there with power over most of the local police, serving in that capacity. Even as Karl-Hermann Frank replaced von Neurath, his position remained unchanged. But there's a big chasm between the two.§!"
