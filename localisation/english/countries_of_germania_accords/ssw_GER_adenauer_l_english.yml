 ssw_GER_adenauer_news.0.d:0 "Adenauer was elected Führer in Germany's elections of last week and, upholding \"cooperation with other countries and the end of all oppression,\" announced a gradual withdrawal from nearly all occupied colonies. Poland and the three Baltic states will become independent after establishing an autonomous government and Northern France, including Paris, will be returned to to its pre-war owners, with the exception of Elsass-Lothringen. This has always been one of Adenauer's anti-imperialist ideas and it will probably constitute good news for the people of the concerned regions, but the announcement is also likely to stem from the desire to reduce the financial burden of colonial management."
