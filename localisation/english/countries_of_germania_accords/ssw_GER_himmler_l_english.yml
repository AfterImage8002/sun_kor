This was because he understood better than anyone else that the Reichsführer had an unusual obsession with cleanliness.\nWolff knew how that concentration camp, where Himmler himself was imprisoned, was as a dumping ground for untermensch, Bolsheviks and traitors.\nWas the Reichsführer safe, or haggard and starving... He once vomited repeatedly after witnessing the gas chambers and, every time that memory flashed through his mind, the ticking of his wristwatch felt terribly loud and annoying.\n\nIn the corner of his blurried vision, he recognized a familiar yet unfamiliar shadow.\nWith a delight he'd never felt before, the Reichsführer was certainly there.\nHe was thinner compared to the last time he saw him, his beard like wild grass. The pupils hidden behind his glasses reminded of the hell he must have experienced, and his gaze was towards the void.\n\nAn impatient Wolff lowered his head a little more awkwardly than usual and called the new leader of the Reich."

The morning roll call started at 6:00.\nHe got ready in a hurry while scolding himself for spending half of the night playing with his friends. Change of clothes, okay. Luggage, okay. Albert did the best he could, running through the somewhat-different town without even realizing it.\n\nKicking open the door of the base with an apology ready to come out of his mouth... he stopped in his tracks and held his breath. No one was there. Wherever he looked, it was devoid of people. He wondered if they were already outside, marching. After a moment, he heard a familiar voice coming from behind him. It was his senior officer. Albert immediately straightened his back, but the other man - far from his usual dignified appearance and showing his exhaustion - only said:\n\"As of today, the 16th Unit you belong to has been effectively disbanded. Get back home quickly.\"\n\nSomething was wrong. It's true he was more late than usual, but did he really commit such a serious blunder?\nIn his confusion, the sound of military boots pierced through Albert's ears. He timidly peered outside the base and couldn't believe his eyes.\n\nSoldiers in black uniforms were lined up in an orderly manner."

A Führererlass (Führer Decree) was promulgated the day before yesterday announcing the \"unconditional dismissal of all Wehrmacht officers''. The military's wrath finally exploded: officers and some remaining divisions declared martial law in Berlin, establishing their own government in what is effectively a coup d'etat. These included a war hero who distinguished themselves in the Blitzkrieg on the Western Front, a famous general who demonstrated outstanding planning skills and intelligence on the Eastern Front, and even a \"fox\" who fought valiantly in the North African deserts.\n\nIt was too late.\nLess than a month after the SS took power, the Wehrmacht had lost all the strength it previously had. Even within the military, many billterly bowed down to Führer Himmler, doing so from a pragmatic point of view. With the Tiger tanks of the Wehrmacht Armored Division placing themselves as if to form a barricade, the officers were moved not by ambition, just a vague sense of justice, of purpose, and ideals.\n\nDull gunshots and black smoke were heard and seen in Berlin within the darkness of Nazi Germany,\nwrapped in black uniforms.\n\nThat day, Berlin was painted black."

He didn't have the time to sort out if what he was feeling was fear, or anger.\nThe pressure that built up in his body blew up and moved him, violently hitting his desk and kicking down a nearby flowerpot, which fell down with an unexplctedly dull sound.\n\"Capture them! Immediately! Don't leave a single traitor within my Ritrerorden!\"\nWhile Himmler raised and brandished his engraved his SS sword in a violent fit of rage, Wolff looked away to collect his thoughts.\nEven if the Waffen-SS had turned, most of the country was still in the hands of the Reichsführer's own SS government. So, they should be able to put the rebels under siege and subdue them. With this in mind, he immediately rushed to the information bureau in search for documents.\n\n... why? Why? WHY?\nFiles on Stuttgart, Hamburg, Bayern and Frankfurt had huge holes regarding their intel.\nThe Rhine appeared as a black spot alongside Thuringia, and the Generalgouvernment had been merged with Bremen.\n\nIt seemed the RSHA has abandoned them as well.\n\nStunned, Wolff went outside. Hell was there. If he looked right, he could see the Gestapo kicking down civilians. On the left, Orpo and the 4th SS unit were engaged in combat. All of a sudden, he saw \"un-German\" faces in his line of vision: slaves. Wave after wave they raged, defying the camp guards' gunfire.\nReflexively rushing into the castle for saftey, Wolff was convinced.\n\nGermany is terminally ill. Its internal organs lie dismantled, while cancer and maggots rampage in various places.\n\nBefore long, screams and gunshots from the other side of the castle gate suddenly stopped and a young man's battle cry, standing out in the confusion, resounded in vain."

 ssw_GER_himmler.14.d:0 "The eyes of the Reich have no blind spots.\n\nEven the full details of Kersten and Dietrich's phone calls were controlled by the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA, Reich Security Main Office).\n\nHimmler's aim,\na final European war involving the [ENG.GetName], the [ITA.GetName], the [SOV.GetName], and the [FRA.GetName].\n\nConsidering the Reichsführer-SS's \"doctrinal'' view of the world, this doesn't unfortunately seem a very unrealistic prospect.\nKaltenbrunner was fearful of this possibility, grinning sternly to hide his internal turmoil.\nAt first, it seemed a rare chance to arrest Kersten, Himmler's protege, and the Waffen-SS Feldmarschall Dietrich, but everything then changed. The whole of Germany... no, a chaos involving the whole world.\nThe sound of a pen taking notes of a conversation felt absurdly loud. We are the RSHA, manipulating all of the Reich, one mistake on our part can wipe out civilization in Europe. Kaltenbrunner managed to keep his cool, even as he broke into a cold sweat from the unimaginable thrill.\n\nHow will the Waffen-SS act? Dietrich's reply was ambiguous, but apparently he had no intention to fully submit to Himmler. Germany will likely be divided between the \"Himmlerites\" and the \"Waffen-SS\". \nKaltenbrunner seems to have cunningly perceived this as an opportunity to \"weaken political opponents.\" The SS-Hauptamt could join this \"veiled civil war\" as the largest force.\n\nKaltenbrunner tore up the report for the Führer, his ambition swallowing even his fear. \n\nSince Himmler became Führer, the government, the economy, and diplomatic relations have been riddled with corruption. We were afraid of his mighty and cruel power, and kept it hidden.\nThat is now over. We need to take back our German Fatherland from the tyrant Heinrich and lead it in the right direction.\nKaltenbrunner, set on his next goal, contacted Karl Hanke, who had just stopped by the headquarters."

He also wondered if Kersten, speaking on the other side o the line, was drunk.\n\n\"invasion of Italy\", \"landing in Britain\", \"nuclear war\"...\n\nRecalling exactly a situation from 10 years ago, the words resounded in his ears like a dream.\nHe's a member of the SS, loyal only to the Führer. Do the Waffen-SS need a traitor who turns his back on his leader?\nAn exemplary subordinate would have exposed Kersten. Or he could pretend that this never happened. That was it. Just pretend to not have heard anything about it.  No reason to get involved.\n\nIn fact, Dietrich didn't find Kersten particularly trustworthy. This may  be a political plot to drive him out. How meaningless was \"trust\" in an state run by the SS? Dietrich once again asked himself what fate he should resign himself to.\n\nWith anguish that could be mistaken for a headache, he involuntarily averted my gaze and saw his compatriots of the \"Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler\" unit relaxing with half a cup of coffee, now a luxury item.\nLooking out the windows of the headquarters, the streets were full of people looking for jobs and sharing food. Even in the city of Bonn, where riots were constant until last year, people were now coming together, looking for a way to live in \"Himmler's Kingdom\".\n\nThe words \"nuclear war\" came to his mind.\n\nWill the peaceful daily life they all seek be consumed by nuclear fire?\nHe thanked one of his tem members for brewing him coffee, drinking it all in one gulp to wash away the troubles stuck in my throat.\nDietrich set his sight on something he should truly serve. He trimmed the brim of his cap, determined.\nA silver totenkopf glitters on his forehead. Dressed in his uniform, the Reichsmarschall marched towards the conference hall."

He had been waiting in his empty office for nearly an hour, finishing to read the book he brought with him in the meantime.\nEarly that morning, he received an order that Himmler's stomach pain was worsening again, and was planning to relax at 5 o'clock of that same day. At this rate, they won't finish the massage session until the time for his late-night snack. Kersten, who had come up with another plan not to inadvertently offend Himmler, suddenly glanced at his desk. On it, there was a huge sheet of paper that stood out among the rest.\nHe turned in the direction of the door. Good, no one there.\nKersten peeped into Himmler's secrets out of mere curiosity.\n\nIncomprehensible\n\nHis eyes didn't recognize it at first. Then, his mind refuses to, and now his whole body and the depths of his soul screamed. He couldn't understand. He didn't want to. His eyes darted around, failing to make sense of the letters,\ndesperately picking up words: \"Reich\", \"final war\", \"Sea Lion\", \"Barbarossa\", \"myths\", \"nuclear\".\n\nHe clutched his stomach, after a sharp pain ran through it. Despite his scrambled thoughts, Kersten had only one instinct, desperate to escape the vague hell, and the fear of loss.\nHe couldn't just do nothing. What to do, then?\nIn his trembling brain, the choice to rely to people made way. Kersten desperately searched for someone he could trust, or at least an influential figure within the SS state...\nThe Chief of Staff Wolff and Himmler were too close, it would be bad if the RSHA found out, someone else to trust...\nRepeating in his head a phone number that came to his mind, Kersten violently picked up the phone and started dialing."

 GER_reorganize_SS_desc:0 "Before, during, and after the war, the SS showed an impressive expansion. However, as a side effect, their discipline has significantly lowered, and their watchful eyes can no longer see within and behing the organization.\nNow that we are in charge of Germany as its true governing body, we need to start reforming the Schutzstaffel's main departments."
 GER_axis_of_knights_desc:0 "The Kommandostab (Command Staff) is a department made up of personal aides to Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, recently becoming known as a \"secret sect\" where sympathizers to extremely esoteric ideas gather.

This was the most foolish act imaginable against Heinrich Himmler, the true leader of the Germanic people, and his knights, and is also the iron chain that we must break first.

 GER_Das_Reich_desc:0 "The 2nd SS Panzer Division \"Das Reich\", a name meaning \"fatherland\" and \"nation\", is one of the most elite divisions in Nazi Germany, including the Wehrmacht, and is also a veteran one, existing since the first days of the SS Special Forces.

 ssw_GER_himmler.13.d:0 "That day was nothing special.\nHimmler got up at 6:00AM as usual, did his basic Germanic exercises, and had a simple breakfast. Gently puuting on his perfectly polished glasses, he waited for Wolff to bring him the documents with a content smile. Himmler relished those usual, boring days.\n\nThe time was 8:19AM. Almost 20 minutes late.\nHimmler enjoyed auditing the beautiful information that Wolff brought on a daily basis more than anything else. But today, no matter how long he waited, the other won't knock on his door.\nBeing late was completely un-Aryan. Himmler's nerves tightened around his throat and he tapped his right index restlessly against the table.\nEven so, a strange mistake for Wolff, who usually did his job without fail. However, he was also a worthy citizen of the Reich, devoting himself blood, flesh, and sweat for the Germanic people every single day. He cooled his head, trying to swallow the negative thougths when,\n\n\"Führer! Führer!\"\nWolff shoved the door open and rushed in. He looked like something was chasing him.\n\"Well, sit down. Time is...\". \"This isn't the time, hurry up!\". Himmler reluctantly opened the document his aide gave him, angry that his pious sermon had been so rudely interrupted.\nHe looked where Wolff was pointing.\nIt was the column for the military personnel numbers. The strange sense of incongruity felt at first soon turned to certainty, and then sublimated into fear.\n\nThe Waffen-SS had vanished overnight.\nOnly \"Number of soldiers: 0\" and \"We only serve the nation\" were left behind.\n\nHimmler's eyes are dizzy and, flinching, he bursts into a fit of rage. \"... what's going on! My, my army!\" \"Calm down, mein Führer! I also can't make heads or tails of the situation, and the RSHA as well...\"\nHimmler's ears lost focus of Wolff's voice, catching a sound coming from outside the window.\nHe ran up and open it with a slam. When he looked down, the source of the noise was 5 or 6 tanks roaring, with soldiers riding them.\nThey headed to Wewelsburg, the tyrant's stronghold."

 ssw_GER_himmler_news.1.d:0 "An announcement from the leader of a certain country engulfed the world in fear: Reichsführer-SS and German Chancellor Heinrich Himmler, after a long period of domestic turmoil, has consolidated his position and is driving Germany back on the war path. His government, adhering to the bizarre ideology of \"Esoteric Nazism\", has declared the revival of a \"Großgermanisches Reich\" spanning all of Europe, effectively declaring war on all nations in its claimed sphere of influence. Already vast numbers of troops are amassing on the borders, while the people of Europe face the glimpse of death before the inevitable war starts.\n\nAmong the countries listed as Himmler's targets in what he called the \"final war\" were major powers like the [ENG.GetName], the [ITA.GetName], the [FRA.GetName] and the [SOV.GetName]. It's still uncertain whether these countries, which also hold grievances against one another, can join forces, but at least the international community seems to be somewhat uniting in the face of a global disaster."

After they are sent to the \"brain\", the SS-Hauptamt, to be processed, the information is passed down to the Orpo and the Gestapo, which faithfully carry out their duties like motor nerves.\nThis created an inorganic, cool-headed, perfect governance system without loopholes to be exploited.\n\nFor the first time, the nerves filled with pus, and rebelled. Many of the country's concentration camps virtually collapsed, as the inmates turned their eyes to the SS in an instant. Bullets cracked the tranquility, peace melted in terror and in blood.\nThe eyes, the ears, the nose... all of Germany's sensory organs were completely undermined: the hands climbed up the nerves of information, relying on the terminals, and eventually reached the brain.\n\nWe are just the brain now. With its limbs torn off, the headquarters is virtually non-functional, and the jurisdiction it had over all the other branches had been reduced to a mere shadow.\n\nKaltenbrunner, forced to surrender, remained silent for a while.

The Waffen SS's desperate \"blitzkrieg\" ended in a stalemate, and their fate was to wait for death, but those who still refused to give up resistance continued to fight vigorously.\nThe 1st SS division Leibstandarte, bearing the name of the \"escort\", is now the final SS bodyguard to Germany, each and every one of its members with a gun risking their life. However, even that resistance now falls apart in the face of great authority.\n\nFor Dietrich, it was painful to hear the battle report. His own decision had taken the lives of 900,000 Waffen-SS soldiers, as well as eventually his own, in a tragic fate. “If only I had turned a blind eye then,” the faint groaning thought gnawed at him over and over again. By the time he realized it, it was irreversible.\nThe enemy was too powerful. There's nothing a Reichsmarschall whose resolve had wavered can achieve. Depressed breaths dulled the air in the command room, perhaps for the last time.\n\nAfter the 28th report, when 39 of his compatriots had lost their lives, he reached his limit and left the room with unsteady steps.\n\nA hollow gunshot rang out from behind the door."

 ssw_GER_himmler.8.d:0 "We have hunted down the Esoterik faction, the traitors who plunged the German people into poverty with their childish beliefs, and now only Himmler's last stronghold remains.\nWewelsburg Castle, looking down from atop a hill, is surprisingly simple considering what hides behind its walls, something that could also be said of Heinrich Himmler himself.\n\nRestraining the remaining knights, the tension made the attackers hold their breath while they rushed the castle gates.\nThe light inside the castle was faint, and the eerie \"black sun\" symbols were covered in dust. Quiet like ruins...\nTime to meet the mastermind.\n\nHimmler was sitting in the corner of his study. He was immersed on his read of the Protocols of the Sages of Zion and, when he saw the soldiers pointing their rifles at him... his eyes widened suddenly, eyeballs flashing black and white before falling to the ground alongside his chair.\nThe king of the Aryan knights met a quick end and, despite his grandiose title, his only act of resistance was the splattering of his blood all over his clothes, a stark contrast to his usual tidiness.\n\nThe final moments of Heinrich the Great, who had given birth to an unfathomable hell, tormenting millions of jews, gypsies, slavs, dissidents, and even innocent Germans, were akin to drowning in a lake."

 ssw_GER_himmler.21.d:0 "Planning, searching, and suppressing...\nThe task of cleaning up insurgents was very monotonous. They had no power or weapons. Even though they were revolutionary forces, they couldn't beat the military.\n\nEven now, before his eyes, another tale of meaningless resistance was heading towards its finale. A compatriot who had sworn revolution spurted blood and fell down. The reality was that hope was nothing in front of a gun, its muzzle pointed at each prisoner. Nonetheless, not one hesitated to face the end. Really troublesome.\n\nThe Einsatzgruppen officer finished his job and, grunting while forcefully wiping his fingers, picked up a blood-stained red flag and threw it away."

 ssw_GER_himmler.17.d:0 "After the rebellion of the Waffen-SS and the SS-Hauptamt, we of the Esoterik... or rather, the \"Arier Ritterorden\" have fought with all possible means to defend our true doctrine and ideals. We matched the combat skills of the Waffen-SS, and slipped through the intel network of the SS-Hauptamt to delivered a critical hit. Even during that time, we never once relaxed our weapons against the true enemy, the hated untermenschen.\n\nNone survived our deadly attack:\nThe fools, the criminals, the depraved, the impure, the disloyal, the suspicious, the tainted... all of them wiped out.\nWith the scalpel, we scraped off the malignant pus that had taken root in Germany.\n\nAll the enemies lurking in the shadows are gone.\nNone will bother me anymore.\nNone will threaten me anymore.\nNone will laugh at me anymore.\n\nHimmler has nothing to worry about.\nHowever, he still seemed to be chased by something. Faced with unexplainable impatience, his childlike smile disappeared and a deternied, or maybe arrogant, sense of purpose made way inside of him."
