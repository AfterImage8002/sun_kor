 GER_idea_Fuhrer_Adolf_Hitler_desc: "Perhaps in his 60s, he still sits where he used to issue his manifesto from. His crumpled hands mixed with gray hair invite sympathy stemming from weakness rather than from his many battles. \"Mein Führer...\" a party executive pushed open the room's heavy door. The one designated as \"Führer\" quivered slightly and tried to say something, but soon closed his mouth. The executive bit his tongue several times while reporting on the party's vote and seeking his final approval. After the report was over, the action the other took after a dozen seconds of silence was slowly opening his mouth and uttering with his weak voice a single word: \"Oh.\" Was it the drugs? Was it the diabetes? Both. With his wounded body, he repeatedly tries to leave his seat even during meals; there were days when he suddenly went mad after he had looked outside. Since the party had depended on him thus far, as it did before, it seems that it had descended into chaos since the Führer had become an institution instead of an actual brain. And he understands. He will disappear from his seat in the not too distant future, and the vacancy will probably have grave consequences for Germany."
