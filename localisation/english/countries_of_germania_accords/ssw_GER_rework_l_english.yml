Many of them were against this and retired from the army in protest. Some worried officers organized in a new internal clique, but this only helped intensify factional conflicts between officers. Taking advantage of the turmoil, the Air Force and Navy were seized by NSDAP-aligned officers, as most of the General Staff were conservatives who supported Göring. The few remaining Prussian officers are against the NSDAP's seizure of the military apparatus. Under these circumstances, it's extremely difficult for the Wehrmacht to officially support one of the Führer's successors."
 GER_idea_Endless_Resistance:0 "Endless Resistance"

The Gestapo have had many opportunities to detain resistance members in the past, but have rarely been able to extract any information. On the other hand, there are many cases where our agents, especially the newly-assigned ones, are attacked and annihilated by them. Recently, such insidious sabotages have occurred frequently not only in France, but also in areas under Germany's direct control, such as Zurich and Warsaw, as well as in every Reichskommissariat. It's not an exaggeration to say that our local security forces are in a state of collapse."

 GER_Question_to_NASDAP:0 "Question the NSDAP"
 GER_Question_to_NASDAP_desc:0 "The direction the NSDAP is heading toward is, to be completely honest, different from what the Führer expected.

Aren't the ones we are oppressing those that will truly illuminate the future?"
 GER_paranoia:0 "Paranoia"

 GER_Interference_with_Goering_desc:0 "Göring wasn't named as successor, but we mustn't let our guard down, since he's the head of Germany's number one organization, the Wehrmacht. Our best bet is to reduce his influence."
 GER_Doubts_about_SS:0 "Doubt the SS"
 GER_Doubts_about_SS_desc:0 "The SS were created as the armed branch of the NSDAP, for the sake of Germany and for the realization of our noble ideals. However, now its importance has been halved. On the contrary, their very existence is detrimental to the NSDAP and, by extension, to Germany itself. Are they really necessary?"
 GER_Heir_to_Fuhrers_Will:0 "Inheritor of the Führer's Will"
 GER_Heir_to_Fuhrers_Will_desc:0 "It was Goebbels who took on the mantle of Führer. This is exactly why he is the true heir to the NSDAP's founding philosophy."

 GER_Nostalgia_for_Wehrmacht_desc:0 "The attack on Göring certainly reduced his influence within the Wehrmacht. We have to move on to the next step and entice them to our side."

 GER_Exposing_reality_of_NCD_desc:0 "The public is not very familiar with the Reichskommissariats, especially those further east. However, their situation is miserable, with the native population exploited with forced labor and the intensifying resistance activities. We must make this acts of violence carried out by the SS public, making the people lose trust in them."
 GER_Repression_of_Resistance:0 "Suppress Resistance"

 GER_dreams_of_eastan_survival_area_desc:0 "The Lebensraum im Osten is essentially a buffer zone against the Germany's enemies in the east, as well as our breadbasket. Its existence is often regarded as giving Germany endless benefits. We must pursue this ideal even further."

 GER_Reference_to_46_plans_desc:0 "The '46 Plan is a large-scale military expansion project drafted in the year 1946. However, with questions about the need for an arms race starting to appear, we must decide whether or not to go forward with the plan."
 GER_Expansion_of_Reserves:0 "Expand the Reserves"
 GER_Expansion_of_Reserves_desc:0 "Whether by expanding or making new armament contracts, the number of military personnel in reserve must inevitably increase. No matter how low, the probability of succumbing to foreign aggression must be removed."
 GER_Expansion_of_SS:0 "Expand the SS"
 GER_Expansion_of_SS_desc:0 "A further expansion of the Waffen-SS is Himmler's greatest desire. Complying would increase their influence, but we will also get their support."
 GER_Expansion_of_Wehrmacht:0 "Expand the Wehrmacht"
 GER_Expansion_of_Wehrmacht_desc:0 "Göring hopes to expand the Wehrmacht, but this would require enormous costs. We should consider the matter carefully."

Taking advantage of the turmoil, the Air Force and Navy were seized by NSDAP-aligned officers, as most of the Air General Staff were conservatives who supported Göring. The few remaining Prussian officers are against the NSDAP's seizure of the military apparatus. Under these circumstances, it's extremely difficult for the Wehrmacht to officially support one of the Führer's successors."

It brings back memories.\"\nHe arranged for the escort to stop, parked the car to the road side, and opened the door.\nThen, it happened:\n\"Mein Führer, look out!\"\nThe sound of two gunshots rang out throughout the quiet town.\n\"Tod dem Faschismus, Freiheit für die Menschen!\" (Death to fascism, freedom to the people!).\nThe culprit shouted and tried to escape, but was shot dead on the spot.\n\"Mein Führer! Mein Führer!\"\nThe supreme leader had collapsed to the floor.\n\"Hurry! Hurry up and get help!\"\n... as it later turned out, the bullets missed all vital organs, allowing the Führer to survive.\nHowever, he's still unconscious and even if he were to wake up, the injuries would make it impossible for him to carry out government affairs as before."

The Navy and the Army have always clashed with each other for budget, while the Airforce has continued to grow, much to the other two branches' chagrin, ever since Göring was given control over the armed forces. However, now the situation has gone awry: Wehrmacht generals spend their days engaged in power struggles, while soldiers' salaries, food, and ammunition keep disappearing into the upper echelon's pockets, Feldmarschall included. Having lost its unity, the organization is becoming warped beyond recognition, and it may not be long before everything good about it is lost."

However, it was on this occasion he would give what he considered his most important and passionate speech. This was his first public appearance since his appointment as next Führer. He spoke briefly but strongly about the party's ideas, his own, and the future of his Fatherland.

However, this naturally fell apart after his passing, making the Berlin stock market fall. While this still can't be considered a plunge per se, the stock values are steadily declining. This is spreading to the people: already, cues wanting to withdraw their savings have formed at many banks, which announced plans for a massive restructuring to prepare for the operating deficit. It goes without saying that this state of emergency was caused by the extraordinary trust the German nation placed in a single human being, everyone feeling this to be only the beginning."

Speaking of which, they also have many interests there, one of which is the staggering amount of budget allocated to them each year under the pretext of keeping public order in the region. Partly for this, withdrawing is a sour concept for the military to stomach, with many Feldmarschals and Generals voicing their opposition. \"Are you going to waste all the blood our brethren shed in Moskowien and in the Kaukasus!?\" they exclaimed in unison.

However, these areas have long been inhabited by Germans, and have received many settlers since the establishment of the Lebensraum im Osten.

Needless to say, the election was fiercely contested.\nGoebbels, popular with the public in the first round, immediately advanced to the runoff alongside Göring.\nThe former finally won in the final round.\nIn his victory speech, he proclaimed: \"I will bring new light in Germany after Hitler's death.\"\nThe land that Hitler loved so much will be developed by Goebbels from now on."

As a result, the nation is expected to leave the NSDAP's one-party dictatorship behind, returning to a political system similar or equal to that of the former Weimar Republic. However, this is very inconvenient: if the new government were to condemn the actions of the Nazis, it would almost certainly target the SS and their units, which includes us.

However, while we have many soldiers on military service in the area, some have pointed out that elements in the Wehrmacht may take a hardline stance, creating the risk of paralizing the mobilization of our military apparatus."
