 ssw_GER_schumacher.0.title:0 "Within the Oppression"
 ssw_GER_schumacher.0.desc:0 "The German Social Democratic Party (SPD) originated from the German Socialist Workers' Party, formed in 1875, and was a major force behind the Weimar Republic and its Constitution in the post-World War I chaos. Even after that, the SPD was always at the political core of Germany, but the rise of Nazism changed it all. Many political parties, including the SPD, were outlawed after they took power, many of its members imprisoned. Faced with the fact that it was defeated by Nazism and collapsed from within, much in the same way Stalinism, which shared Marx's thoughts, later crumbled in front of Hitler, the SPD changed its fundamental ideals. Party members came to the conclusion that Germany couldn't go back to before that fateful day of 1933, which then brought about a basic question about the nature of socialism. And now, as the chaos ended and the dust settled, the SPD has finally won. They must lead the new Germany by asking themselves this question with even more conviction. This was not a simple victory for them, but a \"release\" from their \"defeat\" in 1933, while they feel that the election itself was only \"allowed\" to be won thanks to the Wehrmacht's benevolence. The country is as unstable as that time. When they're finally able to calm this choas, will they be freed from the curse of self-doubt, or will they face new challenges? It can only be known by never giving up."

 ssw_GER_schumacher.1.title:0 "Provisional national title issue"
 ssw_GER_schumacher.1.desc:0 "The SPD's victory has triggered and forced change everywhere, both inside and outside Germany. The name of the country is one such example. Schumacher had long expressed a strong desire to revise the obsolete Weimar Constitution and the need for a new name for the country. At the same time, however, Germany is currently facing a number of immediate tasks, and it is also true that a lot of time is needed before the constitution can be revised. Therefore, some in the party are calling for the use of the name \" Republic of Germany\" to indicate a temporary return to the Weimar Republic. On the other hand, however, many supporters of the Wehrmacht and the NSDAP are opposed to the use of \" State of Germany,\" a name that has been used consistently since the days of Imperial Germany, and they argue that the name should not be reversed. It is also a fact that there are a certain number of people who think that we should make some concessions to them, which will require some cooperation in the future. It is only the name of the country. But at the same time, we must keep in mind that this choice has the potential to greatly influence our future."

 ssw_GER_schumacher.2.desc:0 "Winning an election is not always an absolute triumph. So far, in Germany at least, many enjoyed Nazism's benefits and now they are afraid public interests will be harmed, and may be blamed for it. The NSDAP's power base changed greatly due to Himmler's coup and the subsequent unrest, but it didn't disappear completely. Their past rule has given them a high degree of know-how and, for us who are still struggling, it's not so bad to have them on side. At the same time, we are also making a compromise with our enemies, which could provoke anger within the party and among our supporters. Instead of a triumphant victory over Nazism, we are now walking on thin ice."
 ssw_GER_schumacher.2.a:0 "One can't survive with ideals alone"
 ssw_GER_schumacher.3.title:0 "Kurt Schmücker"
 ssw_GER_schumacher.3.desc:0 "Kurt Schmücker has been an advocate of social democracy since the days of the Weimar Republic. He's anti-communist and an anti-Nazi at heart, always looking harshly at parties championing those ideologies. He was arrested shortly before the passage of the Enabling Act of 1933, and imprisoned in a concentration camp for nearly a decade after refusing to sign a renunciation of political activity. In the autumn of 1942, he was released after the desperate pleas of his brother-in-law. Afterwards, he was forced to recover in an internment camp due to a worsening wound on the arm he lost during World War I, but kept in touch with fellow SPD members who secretly fled. With the end of Germany's war with the Soviet Union, government crackdown was temporarily eased. Nevertheless, democratic organizations, especially Social Democrats who were equated to Communists, were severely suppressed and lost many members. Under this circumstances, the German economic crisis and the subsequent unemployment sparked the once-dormant democratization movement, strongly associated with anti-Nazi sentiments, rapidly expanding its power. Schmücker didn't miss this opportunity: after several years of medical treatment, his chronic illness had somewhat recovered, leaving him with more than enough charisma to greatly promote the movement. After Himmler overthrew the government, he was wanted as a major political agitator. As they executed many of the arrested activists, Schmücker moved from one hideout to another with a few companions. That phase quickly ended with the Wehrmacht counter-coup, and he took action ahead of the declaration of free elections. The fact that the Soviet Union, supposed to have been overthrown long ago, began to move toward revival was also a stroke of luck for the anti-Communist Schmücker. So, he and his party won the election campaign, and were given a golden opportunity to revitalize Germany. However, the regime is difficult to hold by the SPD alone. The Wehrmacht, and the NSDAP remnants still hold great influence. Working with them is also an option. On the other hand, Schmücker is uncompromising and, if his attitude is part of the charisma that brought the SPD back together, then cooperation would be a bad move."

Negotiations for the return of the region have been held several times during Hitler's reign, but the demands of the two sides didn't mix and, most importantly, the Führer had shown considerable reluctance to return the land, which leaves us with the current situation. For Germany, the region is a heavy burden and an unavoidable obstacle to friendly relations with the neighboring countries. Also, many German companies and government-owned factories have been built in northern France, so it's necessary to decide what to do with these when the territory is returned. Retaining only the right to operate the factories while returning everything else is an option, but it's more than likely that the French government won't keep such a promise. The former French territory includes part of Reichskommissariat Belgien, with a heated debate as to whether that should also be returned."

Rather, its strategic position against Great Britain and as a bridge to the Nordic countries, which fear the expansionist regimes growing anew in Russia, has only increased of late.

Fortunately, the outcome of their political change can help us to remove these constraints and create a favorable situation for us. While Danish military and economic dependence is extremely high, domestic calls for further autonomy are growing day by day and so, in return for promising the Schmücker government to stay in the German sphere of influence, we could potentially obtain diplomatic rights and then full independence.

After the war, Germany had been developing new weapons emphasizing firepower and armor-based combat, with the '46 Plan described by many as the culmination of that effort. However, considering the United States and Far Eastern conflicts, our plans may not necessarily be up to date. This is also the consensus within the Wehrmacht and, in response, Rommel has proposed to reorganize our armored and mechanized divisions with greater emphasis on mobility, according to the need to carry out deep and mobile attacks with ground support from the Luftwaffe.

Countries threatened by communist forces and some great powers sharing the same ideology expect this organization to yield positive results, by preventing troubles to reach their doorsteps.

The new and amended constitution, while carrying over the people's rights stipulated in the Weimar one, improves on the vulnerability of democratic politics exposed by the Nazis after the Great Depression, revamping much of the political system. The constitutional ceremony was held at the Sanssouci Palace in Potsdam, the state capital of Brandenburg, where Schmücker emphasized the end of traditional, discriminatory imperialism and the dawn of a new era for Germany."
