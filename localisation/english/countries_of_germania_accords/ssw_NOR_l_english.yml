 NOR_panic_in_army:0 "Chaos in the Army"
 NOR_panic_in_army_desc:0 "The decline in the authority of the national government and the decline in the loyalty of its officers due to the outbreak of the German Civil War had left the military in a state of chaos, and it virtually has no fighting strength."
 NOR_event.1.t:0 "Large-scale Strike occured in Oslo"
 NOR_event.1.d:0 "A wave of strikes by coal mine workers, which have been ongoing since the end of last year in the North, have now reached Oslo.\nThe movement, stemming from the government refusing the demand for better wages and working conditions by the Longyearbyen miners - located in the arctic island of Svalbard - has gradually spread southwards until it finally reached Oslo, capital and largest city of the Reichskommissariat Norwegen.\nDespite banning unaffiliated trade unions in 1941, factory workers in Oslo have often started coordinated strikes. This time too, they're fiercely resisting the police and Hirden forces with stones and Molotov cocktails, while the government is confident that these union-led protests are tied to the internal resistance movement, the \"Norwegian Liberation Front\", and to its militia \"Milorg\".\nIn any case, it's surely going to take enormous time and effort to suppress the strikes and for workers to go back to their jobs, and thus returning country-wide production levels to normal, making the prospect of economic and political damage inevitable."
 NOR_event.1.a:0 "Bastards!"
 NOR_event.2.t:0 "Train Raided in the Midlands"
 NOR_event.2.d:0 "Another weak point in the National Government's internal security network has been exposed. On July 10, just before dawn, a railroad track was blown up by someone near Dunderland, a small village located in central Nordland. A train loaded with military supplies, seeing the missing tracks, stopped and got attacked. The German garrison in Bodo rushed the next day after being notified by a local police officer who heard the explosion, but the assailants had already erased their tracks and escaped. On the scene, only three things were left: the derailed and still-burning locomotive, a firearm, and the empty freight car which once housed all the ammunitions.\nThe damage wasn't just limited to the fact that a large amount of military supplies are now into the resistance's hands: although there've been frequent attacks on vehicles carrying military supplies, all had so far targeted civilian convoys in the Arctic Circle. In the central regions, where government authority was thought to be strong, a large-scale attack couldn't have been planned, nor would've succeeded, without access to confidential information. The realization has shocked not only the National Government, but also by the Germans.\nWhile the sharp deterioration of its support base is common knowledge, officials and state newspapers have repeatedly stated: \"the government and the military are in full control, and the rebels are being overwhelmed\", which is certainly not the case."
 NOR_event.2.a:0 "Gloomy flies!"
 NOR_event.3.d:0 "Since the beginning of the year, internal security had been deteriorating at an alarming rate, with attacks on railroads occurring in quick succession after the nation-wide strike. Nevertheless, in none of the cases in which direct or indirect resistance involvement was suspected did Milorg come in contrast with the government. As only their existence remained known, many high-ranking National Government officials have stated that the German \"mass cleanup operation\" led by the Reichskommissar himself, may have overestimated the rebels' strength. Apparently, they were right.\nThe Harstad Arsenal, located on the outskirts of Harstad (Tromso), was the only Norwegian weapon storage built after the war... until last night.\nThe resistance attacked the heavily-guarded arsenal in a surprise operation. The guards were instantly incapacitated by snipers hidden in the nearby mountains, while the platoon which rushed in after the lack of scheduled contact was forced to retreat with a large number of casualties, result of a fierce shooting against rebel forces lurking on the side of the road. A mortar was also shot at a nearby garrison and, immediately after resistance and Hirden troops engaged each other, the latter, well equipped but poorly trained, was overwhelmed and had to abandon ship. By dawn, when a Ju-87 dive bomber was launched from the Orland Flystasjon to wipe out the rebels, these had already disappeared into thin air.\nAs the Reichskommissar and the National Government are rapidly losing control of the North, the political situation in Germany is becoming more tense. The resistance, after eight years of subjugation, is now beginning to move towards its goal: overthrowing Germany and their puppet government."
 NOR_event.3.a:0 "What's happened?"
 NOR_event.4.t:0 "Withdrawal of the German Troops"
 NOR_event.4.d:0 "Due to the extreme chaos in Germany, Reichskommissar Terboven has announced the suspension of all administrative functions of Reichskommissariat Norwegen, delegating authority to the Nasjonale Regjering. All Third Reich forces stationed in Norway have fully withdrawn, most returning home to support Goebbels, while sources say some of the troops stationed in Northern Finmark fled to Finland.\nThe effects of the withdrawal of the German forces, responsible for maintaining security in the country for the past eight years, will potentially be devastating."

His consistent anti-German fighting, and his devotion to his nation and its people, have made him many enthusiastic supporters dissatisfied with the ruthless rule of Germany and of its puppet government.
