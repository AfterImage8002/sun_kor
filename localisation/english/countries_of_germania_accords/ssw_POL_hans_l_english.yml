 gg_hans.9.d:0 "Generalbebauungsplan von Krakau is an ambitious plan made by Hubert Ritter, developed in 1940, to rebuild Krakow out of its Polish roots.\n\nIt’s currently being done in our beautiful city under supervision of Hubert himself and all our cabinet. Mainly due to fact we can see it being done from our windows on Wawel Castle. Our capital must be the greatest thing in new General Government, mainly to show that Germans long ago owned this terrain for themselves. It is estimated that until 1951 all work will be finished and thus end the story of Polish city.\n\nWe also started our new plan - Generalplan für den Wiederaufbau von Bronowice-Krowodrza. It’s intended to create Germania-like streets with apartments for our dearest citizens of Reich. The main district hall for Bronowice will be at Helden der Befreiung von Krakau strasse 13 (currently known as Jerzego Samuela Bandtkiego). We already planned to build there small garrison as well as Tanzsaal for our citizens. We also planned to do metro section there, furthermore connect it to main metro line. \n\nAfter that, we’ll build huge Reichpark where we will present futuristic technology of Reichsminister Adolf Speer as well as park in honour of dead soldiers of Germany. Krowodrza however will be merged into Bronowice and final name of district will be “Bronowitz-Neustadt”. \n\nApparently, there are some rumours about secret hall under that place so we shall investigate it as soon as possible. SS and our local Wehrmacht are already conducting preparations."
