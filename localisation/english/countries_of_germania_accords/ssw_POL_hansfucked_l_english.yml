We have a problem. \" Ohlenbusch on the other side of phone. \"There are rumors of suspected operation, covered by Resistance.

What Gestapo found was small network of workers trying to smuggle weapons into Hungary. They weren't their main focus, however they provided small clue for further investigation. Sometimes their transport, especially the valuable one dissapeared somewhere between Cracow and Warsaw. It was going through Przemyśl and dissapeared.

If they lay their hand on this, Reich, no, we and Reich are doomed!\" He yelled. \n\n Everything was going acording to plan. They even prepared their own fireplace in the middle of metting hall. Warsaw was under heavy assault but Hans was determined to ensure that these documents would burn. Inside there was a lot of information that could lead to colapse of Reich and other countries.\n\nBut when all was looking good and documents were prepared to be burned, Hans heard quiet crack outside of the door to meeting hall. All what happened later was just impossible to describe..."
