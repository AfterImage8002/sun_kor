So, with the help of dissident military units, they carried out a military coup d'etat. Successfully seizing the government and arresting the General, domestic turmoil didn't subside, Soprotivleniye Rossiya beginning to show signs of internal factionalism instead.\n\nJapan, which supported Semyonov before, has announced its official recognition of the new administration, guaranteeing for the damages caused by the Uraijo Incident at the same time.

The Semyonov administration, supported by the Japanese government until recently, was weakened and thrown into chaos by the exposure of numerous cases of corruption and silencing of political opponents, taking the [FAE.GetName]'s economy and politics down with it. This caused the creation of the bipartisan, anti-Semyonov force Soprotivleniye Rossiya.\nThe group announced Semyonov's dismissal following a vote of no confidence in the Duma, but his refusal to resign had them carry out a coup with the military's backing. They seem to have succeeded in seizing power and arresting Semyonov, but many still believe the internal unrest won't subside even after their actions.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese government has decided to extend its support to this new administration, but it's unclear whether its Far Eastern counterpart will keep the two countries' relationship as it was before."
