 INS_Romusha_problem_desc:0 "The term Romusha derives from the Japanese word for \"worker\". Those identified by this moniker were dispatched to various area of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and forced to work in low-wage and harsh environments. After the Greater East Asia War, labor demand has been lower than ever, yet none seem to be willing to improve their conditions."

 INS_defenders_homeland_desc:0 "The Tentara Pembela Tanah Air (Defenders of the Homeland), sometimes referred to by its acronym PETA, was established in 1943 as the national army, mainly made up of Indonesians trained in Dutch military academies. Its main purpose is to assist the Japanese army in curbing rebellions, its offensive and military capabilities not deserving much praise. PETA was kept even after the war, where it struggles to contain the organized Communists militias and suffers from widespread internal dissent."
 INS_developing_Indonesian:0 "Developing an Indonesian Language"
 INS_developing_Indonesian_desc:0 "Indonesian is an artificial language created in recent years, after the 1928 Sumpah Pemuda (Youth Pledge) declared that a single language would be used to unite the Indonesian people. It has since become a powerful weapon for Indonesian unification, but the problem is that it hasn't yet reached the rural areas. We have to focus on spreading Indonesian, crushing separatism and aiming for true national unity."

 INS_unstable_Gotong_royong_cabinet_desc:0 "Sukarno, first President of the Republic of Indonesia, formed a government of national unity inspired by the traditional concept of Gotong Royong (communal work), in order to directly introduce Western-style democracy. Initially, he tried to create a single, strong party modeled after the Japanese Taisei Yokusankai, but failed: the supposed coalition is ruptured by disagreements and fierce disputes."
