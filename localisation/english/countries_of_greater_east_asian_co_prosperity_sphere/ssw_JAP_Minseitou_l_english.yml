 ssw_jap.108.d:0 "With the start of Matsumura's new Rural Prosperity Movement, it's no wonder that the countryside will play a leading role in the economic reform. Matsumura himself energetically went to various rural areas with his aide and Deputy Minister of Agriculture Yoshinari Kawai to assess the current situation. It was said that rural villages, abandoned due to the price decline caused by agricultural products coming from overseas, were being reconstructed through a series of reforms.

 JAP_two_pieces_advice:0 "Double Advice?"
 JAP_two_pieces_advice_desc:0 "Prime Minister Miki has little political experience, and is the result of compromise between factions inside the party.

 JAP_political_fundraise_by_Miki_desc:0 "Miki is a fundraising genius: he should visit many businesses and supporters, getting us the funds we need for party politics. In the meantime, he'll have to leave domestic affairs and diplomacy to people behind the scenes, but that can't be helped..."

 JAP_memory_two_party_sys_desc:0 "The Minseito was a great party: before the war, we established a two-party system in the Diet with the Seiyukai, engaging in many political debates. But now, with the birth of the Shakaito and the Kokuminkai, the political situation is more complicated. Although the climate is different, we can revive this past memory, and apply it to the present."
 JAP_from_outside:0 "From Outside?"
 JAP_from_outside_desc:0 "Tadao Oasa was once the face of the Minseito. He was accused of working with the Army to bring an end to parliamentary politics, and for this he was given the cold shoulder by the party, becoming insignificant. Getting him to help may be dangerous, but he's needed by Prime Minister Miki to counter Nomura and Hitotsumatsu's influence, and for the Minseito to embrace more ideologies."

 JAP_adopt_Hitotsumatsu_plan_desc:0 "Hitotsumatsu's plan emphasizes a free market for the sake of gold circulation. The empire's economy is one of the largest in the world, and it's better to let it do its thing rather than controlling it. The government will also be better off, giving only small subsidies to prevent the economy from going in the wrong direction."
 JAP_Mitsubishi_wealth:0 "The Wealth of Mitsubishi"

 JAP_agri_dev_outside_country_desc:0 "Our agriculture is no longer dependent solely on domestic production. The empire has taken over vast lands after the war, gaining a lot of wealth.

 JAP_increase_employment_military_industry_desc:0 "Japan's economy is growing well, but there's one overlooked sector: the munitions industry. Even though it gained traction during the war, many factories were closed under the postwar disarmament policy, with many technicians losing their jobs and forced to change career.

 JAP_construct_public_house:0 "Build Public Housing"
 JAP_construct_public_house_desc:0 "Kakuei Tanaka has come up with an interesting idea: apartments are more suitable to densely-populated Japan rather than individual homes, so low-rent public housing should be offered to accommodate for the growing urban population."
 JAP_complex_cabinet:0 "A Complicated Cabinet"
 JAP_complex_cabinet_desc:0 "The Miki Cabinet, while far from being disorganized, it's more complex than ever before. At first, it seemed to be a playground for Hitotsumatsu and Matsumura, but then Ooasa was rehabilitated alongside his sway on the party, while relatively young politicians like Kakuei Tanaka also joined in the power struggle. While this situation allows us to hear different opinions, it hinders policy implementation. Either way, it must be sorted out."

 ssw_jap.116.d:0 "Miki sat in the prime minister's seat as he thought about the weight of his responsibilities. A question popped up in his mind: do I really have those responsibilities? I was able to sit in the position of prime minister because of Kenzo Matsumura's and Sadayoshi Hitotsumatsu's recommendation and cooperation. Miki thinks of them as good allies and seniors, advising him on many things, but he wonders whether he could fulfill his duties as prime minister by himself."
 ssw_jap.116.a:0 "I see"
 ssw_jap.117.t:0 "Ooasa's Support"
 ssw_jap.117.d:0 "That day, Miki met Tadao Oasa, a former prominent member of the Minseito. He was deprived of power within the party after the war because he helped in the Minseito-Taisei Yokusankai merger, taking a pro-military stance.\n \nMiki felt that this strange-speaking man still held some sway within the party. When the time came to talk about future policies, Ooasa said: \"I'll give you some advice.\" His opinions on foreign policy and party strategy were particularly interesting, and the whole exchange seemed to be of great significance."
 ssw_jap.117.a:0 "Interesting man"
 ssw_jap.118.t:0 "Clever Politics"
 ssw_jap.118.d:0 "The coup-like power grab by the Seiyukai stuck a deep wedge with the Minseito. In the Diet, a glimpse of the old two-party era can still be seen: members of both groups often argue with one another, and are one of the reasons for the slow legislative progress. \n \nA member of the Minseito, in a debate against a Shakaito MP, used the expression \"clever political disputes\" many times to describe his exchanges with Seiyukai members. His words sounded ironic, and were plenty ridiculed by both Shakaito and Kokuminkai members."
 ssw_jap.118.a:0 "Not clever, emotional"
 ssw_jap.119.t:0 "Busy Stock Exchange"
 ssw_jap.119.d:0 "At the Tokyo branch of the Japan Stock Exchange, transactions are becoming more frequent in proportion to our economical growth. When it was established during the war, it was a lifeless place, as if to symbolize the stagnant and controlled economy. However, nowadays it's the opposite: many voices requesting to buy and sell can be heard, and the staff is often seen running about and working very hard."
 ssw_jap.119.a:0 "One after the other"
 ssw_jap.120.t:0 "Support from Japan"
 ssw_jap.120.d:0 "As Japan has decided to provide massive support to its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere allies, life goods and industrial products are being piled up one after another in every port, and then brought to all parts of every nation by trucks, horses, railroads, etc. \n \nWith this, our country will develop even further."
 ssw_jap.120.a:0 "We appreciate it"
 ssw_jap.121.t:0 "Japan proposes economic cooperation"
 ssw_jap.121.d:0 "Japan has made a shocking proposal: economic cooperation with us, their potential enemy! \n \nThis agreement would benefit both countries, but there are concerns within our government that Japan may be trying to economically subjugate China. We must decide carefully..."

 ssw_jap.122.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ssw_jap.123.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] refuses"
 ssw_jap.123.d:0 "Many pro-Chinese citizens and businesses were discouraged by the news that China has refused our proposal for economic cooperation. The rivalry between China and Japan will not end."
 ssw_jap.123.a:0 "Is it impossible to work with China after all?"
 ssw_jap.124.t:0 "Joint military exercise in Java"
 ssw_jap.124.d:0 "Large-scale military exercises were conducted in various parts of Java. The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Forces, led by a Japanese general, advanced through the island with lightly-equipped mountain infantry, escorted by helicopters suitable for battle in such rugged mountains and dense jungles. At sea, the Royal Thai Navy, the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the Indonesian Navy jointly conducted landing operations, as well as comprehensive exercises on land, sea, and sky. The experience was wonderful display of modern warfare."
 ssw_jap.124.a:0 "Let's learn a lot"
 ssw_jap.125.t:0 "Kakuei Tanaka's plan"
 ssw_jap.125.d:0 "Tanaka is stronger within the party and the cabinet than ever before, and his remarks are increasing accordingly. So, Miki went to meet him to hear his ideas. \n \nTanaka met the Prime Minister in a large office and, after giving a small greeting, unfolded a huge map of Japan. Korea and Taiwan were also shown, and there were many pen marks and lines that seemed to represent railroad tracks and roads for each of the three areas. Tanaka pointed his finger at the map many times, enthusiastically talking about the policies he had thought of. Miki was taken aback by their scale and his enthusiasm. \n \nThe Prime Minister began to pay more attention to how this man walks through the world of politics, and changes Japan."
 ssw_jap.125.a:0 "A grand plan indeed"
 ssw_jap.126.t:0 "Status of the Miki Cabinet"
 ssw_jap.126.d:0 "The members of the Miki Cabinet often disagree amongst themselves because their party is home to various factions. That day, the ministers were arguing about political strategy, a familiar topic for Miki. \n \nMiki thought it was almost time to improve his situation: he's had several years of experience as prime minister, with a track record of appointing ministers of different opinions."
 ssw_jap.126.a:0 "We have to improve"
 ssw_jap.127.t:0 "Ooasa's Plea"
 ssw_jap.127.d:0 "Ooasa laughed and talked to the army officers. Miki sat next to him and listened. The IJA is a strange organization, virtually independent as it moves only at the orders of His Majesty the Emperor, and not at the government's. \n \nThe best way to get them to cooperate is using the connections cultivated during the war by Ooasa. As he thought about this, the pleasantries ended, and the negotiations on military budget began."
