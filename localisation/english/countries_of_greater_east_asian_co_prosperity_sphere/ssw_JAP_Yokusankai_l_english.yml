 SSW_JAP_YOKUSANKAI.0.t:0 "The morning of bureaucracy"
 SSW_JAP_YOKUSANKAI.0.d:0 "A bureaucrat's morning comes with yesterday's fatigue. Since the Kido administration began, the political influence of former bureaucrats Nobusuke Kishi and Hayato Ikeda increased, and so did us bureaucrats' workload. As I went to the Ministry of Finance to prepare for work as per usual, at the morning assembly the upper management announced the start a campaign to unite the staff. Really depressing, as it means more work to do... After finishing the morning taks, like sorting the Diet's correspondence and preparing for law amendments, afternoon naturally comes. I'm then busy with work until late at night, when I finish preparations for tomorrow, the clock pointing 2:00AM. Again, I begin my short sleep before a morning during which you can't get tired. Unless Japanese politics grind to a halt, this cicle won't stop."

 SSW_JAP_YOKUSANKAI.1.d:0 "Nobusuke Kishi, missing the time when he was Governor of Korea, went on a trip there. He stayed in the peninsula for a while, and it seems like he enjoyed his vacation at a villa near Hanseong (Seoul). However, being a politician and all, the villa was often visited by military personnel, foreign dignitaries, and officials from the General Government of Korea. Current Prime Minister Koichi Kido also went there, and visited the estate on the shore. It was unusual for the Prime Minister to come that far and, even though Kishi knew of his visit in advance, when Kido arrived the other seemed unable to hide his surprise and joy. After welcoming him to the best of his ability, Kishi discussed government policy and politics with him in the guest room, and when it was time for the Prime Minister to return home, he saw him off until his car disappeared into the horizon. It can be said that this visit served to strengthen the alliance between Kishi and Kido, increasing the former's influence within the Kokuminkai."
