 JAP_indochina_war_desc:0 "Indochina has been one of the hottest point of tension between Japan and China ever since the Tonkin Incident. Today, the crisis finally reached its limit and fighitng began to occur. China's puppet government in Tonkin has attacked our allies the Empire of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, which now all find themselves in danger. We cann't afford to abandon our sphere members, and we must do everything in our power to support them against China's expansionist ambitions."

 JAP_start_humanitarian_aid:0 "Send humanitarian aid"
 JAP_start_humanitarian_aid_desc:0 "In Vietnam, many citizens are now dying from poor livign conditions. Although this war is absolutely necessary for the reunification of their country, this humanitarian crisis can't be overlooked. Efforts should be made to alleviate damages caused by the war by sending food and clothes to Indochina through the Japanese Red Cross and other charitable organizations."
 JAP_damage_minimization:0 "Minimize the damage"
 JAP_damage_minimization_desc:0 "It's expected that many Japanese and their living areas will suffer during the war. Damage is one of the most abhorrent things in a conflict, encouraging the people's dislike of it and making post-war reconstruction difficult. In order to reduce this to a minimum, we'll actively set up field hospitals and military infrastructure."
 JAP_best_training:0 "Provide the best training"
 JAP_best_training_desc:0 "Among the principles of Japan's intervention in the Indochina War, we recognize this to be a war for the Vietnamese. After conducting examinations on intervention methods following this principle, we came to the conclusion that we should avoid direct intervention of Japanese troops as much as possible, and focus instead on supporting the Vietnamese army. So, we'll send a large number of officers to Vietnam to train their military thoroughly, making it equal on skill with the Imperial Japanese Army!"
 JAP_support_rapid_military_modernize:0 "Support rapid military modernization"
 JAP_support_rapid_military_modernize_desc:0 "The Vietnamese military is plagued by corruption, equipment shortages, disloyalty, and many other problems. Now that we have entered in a state of war, this issue should be resolved immediately. We will do our best to support the modernization of the Vietnamese army, raise it to a level where it can fight alone!"
 JAP_training_vietnam_air_force:0 "Train the Vietnamese Airforce"
 JAP_training_vietnam_air_force_desc:0 "In the Vietnamese skies, Chinese and Japanese planes are constantly clashing, while Vietnamese planes are rarely seen and, when they are, they're all pitifully outdated. In order to make Vietnam's skies truly belong to Vietnam, we'll help their fight with the Japanese Air Force."
 JAP_enble_success:0 "Make victory possible"
 JAP_enble_success_desc:0 "When the war in Vietnam began, there were doubts about the Empire's ability to continue the war, as the overwhelming numbers of the Chinese army and the Tonkin government forces seemed to have the upper hand and controlled the industrial areas. However, Vietnam seems to have finally developed said ability, thanks to the huge amount of support from Japan. More preparations are being made even now for this national disaster."
 JAP_full_support:0 "Full support"
 JAP_full_support_desc:0 "The Indochinese brothers are being threatened by China as they have been for centuries. If we abandon them, we'll allow the Sinicization of Indochina, while Thailand, Malaya and Burma will be attacked by their fangs and, eventually, even our empire may be forced to submit to them. In order to prevent this worst-case scenario to begin, Japan should use all its power to support Indochina."
 JAP_crush_anti_war_move:0 "Suppress the anti-war movements"
 JAP_crush_anti_war_move_desc:0 "The protest movement by cowardly pacifists and heretical political activists is gaining momentum due to our decision to actively intervene in the Indochina War. Why can't they understand this is a holy war that will decide the fate of Greater East Asia and the empire? We'll make even the stupided of persons understand the situation the empire is in... by using the police."
 JAP_indochina_red_cross_org:0 "Organize the Indochinese Red Cross"
 JAP_indochina_red_cross_org_desc:0 "The Indochina War is not just a concern for the Imperial Japanese Army and government: all citizens must come together to protect Indochina and Greater East Asia. We will organize patriotic citizens, veterans, and political activists in a \"Relief Team for Indochina\" to protect locals and Japanese there, entrusting logistical support to the military, and finding volunteers and collecting donations domestically."
 JAP_increase_num_military_advisor:0 "More military advisors"
 JAP_increase_num_military_advisor_desc:0 "You can't win a war with just soldiers, no matter how many you have. By training unskilled Vietnamese officers and sending a large number of Japanese officers who can command the army instead, the Vietnamese army will be reborn and will produce great results as a second Japanese army."
 JAP_more_unit:0 "More troops"
 JAP_more_unit_desc:0 "Many, many more divisions are needed to defend Indochina. It's certain that costs will increase, but it's necessary for victory. The ports of Nagasaki and Hiroshima will be filled with soldiers ready to go to war, in a patriotic and Pan-Asian frenzy!"
 JAP_joint_air_force:0 "Joint Airforce"
 JAP_joint_air_force_desc:0 "The Vietnam Air Force is too weak: young pilots unafraid to crash use outdated fighters, air officers are scarce, so Japanese instructors and modern military aircrafts are needed to solve these problems. We should send a lot of military planes even if the Vietnamese aren't able to fly them right away. Quality will outweigh quantity, and overwhelm Tonkin's Air Force."
 JAP_endless_support:0 "Provide total support"
 JAP_endless_support_desc:0 "We must win this battle at any cost. It's stupid to think in terms of costs and damages anymore. Japan is Asia and Asia is Japan. Just as there are stupid governments and armed forces hesitating to defend their own territories, we should instead defend Indochina at any cost."
 JAP_burn_and_move:0 "Burn and advance!"
 JAP_burn_and_move_desc:0 "The war is intensifying, and the situation doesn't allow us to let our guard down. We have to secure victory, and there's no time to worry about local damages. Caves likely to contain Viet Minh or Tonkin soldiers will be burned to the ground with flamethrowers, and all stupid villages that cooperate with them will fall to napalm! Even if Indochina returns to the Stone Age, the Imperial and Vietnamese armies will enter Hanoi in triumph!"
 JAP_weapon_against_vietnamese:0 "Weapons for the Vietnamese"
 JAP_weapon_against_vietnamese_desc:0 "China has provided much support to the Tonkin government, so Japanese arms are essential for the country to successfully defend and win. Many Vietnamese soldiers will be delighted to see the latest Japanese weapons, and won't have to worry about equipment."
 JAP_call_allies:0 "Call our allies"
 JAP_call_allies_desc:0 "This isn't just a war between Japan and Indochina, but between all nations of Greater East Asia. Therefore, we hope that everyone participates one way or another. Japan should send a request for reinforcements to Indonesia and Manchukuo, both believed to have a surplus of military forces, and should seize victory in Indochina with the other countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
 JAP_pheasant_over_vietnam:0 "The Pheasant over Vietnam"
 JAP_pheasant_over_vietnam_desc:0 "Bombing is a method of attack worthy of a great power, and China's weak Tonkin Air Force can't prevent it. A large pheasant donning a Hinomaru flag will fly over Vietnam and burn everything with grace. Strategic bombing will leave the enemy out of strength and production capacity, bringing us closer to victory."

 ssw_jap_diplomacy.1.t:0 "A telegram from Saigon"
 ssw_jap_diplomacy.1.d:0 "That day, the war in Indochina was a hot topic within the Imperial Diet. However, there weren't any specifics in those discussions, driven by speculations mixed in with facts and opinions instead. Despite the debates being less than productive, Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] was frustrated by his inability to adequately address the opposition's accusations.\n\nA visitor came to the office just as the Prime Minister was about to go home, finding him saying goodbye to his staff, the workday being over. The man introduced himself as Maeda, a bureaucrat working at the Ministry of War. He informed the other that the 38th Army of Saigon had finished gathering intelligence, and sent a telegram to Tokyo revealing the multiple incidents discovered by the investigation. \n\nIn Saigon, several Japanese were apparently killed in a simultaneous terrorist attacks by Viet Minh guerrillas and, a few days ago, an imperial citizen was even kidnapped by the Tonkin army. The news prompted the Prime Minister to hold an emergency cabinet meeting, followed by an impromptu press conference. The sun rose by the time all the work was done, leaving Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] to wonder about what it would bring."

 ssw_jap_diplomacy.2.d:0 "The Japanese were strangely hot-headed compared to Vietnamese soldiers. Nguyen Tran, a cadet who recently received intense training from one of their officers, was left with that impression. While he thought about it, one of the always-enthusiastic Japanese instructors shouted for roll call, gathering all the Vietnamese soldiers.\n\nWhile he looked at tanks and weapons he'd never seen before, the instructor proudly talked about that Japanese equipment, explaining in detail the \"Vietnamese Army Modernization Plan\" promoted by his homeland. Due to his low understanding in the Japanese language, he didn't get the details, but knew that they would learn everything about the weapons and be the driving force behind the program.\n\nAlong with the heavy responsibility of having to learn many things to protect the homeland, doubts began to emerge whether the Vietnamese army could fight without the Japanese."

 JAP_victory_industry_desc:0 "No matter how strong an army is, it will eventually weaken and suffer defeat due to exhaustion. To prevent this scenario from happening to our compatriots in Indochina, we must provide Vietnam with technical advice and industrial tools to help achieve a victory through industry."
 JAP_communicate_from_38th_army_desc:0 "War has begun in Indochina, and we have no time to lose. We need to help our brethren immediately. Stull, if we were to intervene without gather intel first, we might be defeated by China and their slaves in Tonkin. Therefore, we must contact the 38th Army stationed in Indochina and have them investigate the local situation. What's the enemy's military strength? Do we have enough weapons and ammunition? Can the Vietnamese Imperial Army win?"
 JAP_protect_assets_japanese_desc:0 "On the front lines, the Tonkin forces are using Chinese artillery shells, causing many deaths and damaging the lands held by the Empire of Vietnam. Meanwhile, further south, the Viet Minh have become more active, harming many civilians in terrorist attacks. Indochina isn't the only victim of this war: Japanese people living there are also suffering. As the Japanese government, we have a duty to rescue them and their property. We shall work with the local military and police forces to repatriate some of them."
 JAP_their_own_fight_desc:0 "No matter how much Japan and its allies or the Chinese fight, the Indochina War is still fought by the Vietnamese. It would be idiotic to forget the unification of Vietnam in favor of strange ambitions, and so we must adhere to the principle of \"support\". By adhering to this concept, it should be possible to dispel our people's fears of becoming involved in this war."
