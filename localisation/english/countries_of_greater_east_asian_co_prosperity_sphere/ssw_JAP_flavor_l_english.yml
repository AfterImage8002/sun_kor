 ssw_jap_flavor_news.0.d:0 "The \"Kongo\", or Kongo-class battleship, is Japan's first Super-dreadnought Battlecruiser, as well as their last capital ship to be built in the United Kingdom. At the time of its completion, it was known as the strongest of its type in the world, continuing to fight on the frontlines even during the Greater East Asia War. However, problems began to occur aboard due to its age, and it was decommissioned. Still, at some veterans' and the public's requests, it was decided to mothball and preserve it. The \"Kongo\" is now being stored in its home port of Yokosuka, next to the British battleship \"Mikasa\", active during the Battle of Tsushima."

 ssw_jap_flavor.3.d:0 "The \"Mikasa no Kai\", a private organization created to preserve the Memorial Ship Mikasa, has launched a restoration and reconstruction project to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the ship's inauguration. The group is sponsored by several companies, with most of the funding coming from donations. According to the organization's chairman, national funding is also essential in order to make the Mikasa, a ship of honorable service during the Russo-Japanese War, more widely known to the public, and is therefore requesting support. Since, even without government support, they have no major money issues, this plan can go through without the nation's contribution. However, as the chairman said, many are of the opinion that government support would further cooperation between the military and the civilians. On the other hand, some within the administration regard the request as a desire to add \"prestige\" to this plan via state funding, while others are skeptical about providing the navy with said budget, since it's only a private boat. Which stance should the government take?"
