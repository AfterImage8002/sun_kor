 ssw_jap.0.desc:0 "At the beginning of the Diet's ordinary session, Prime Minister Yoshizawa gave a speech on his government's policy. He mentioned all the areas of the administration, but took some time to talk about the failure of his predecessors Kenzo Matsukata and Mamoru Shigemitsu to reform the House of Peers. He pointed out that the higher House's curent system of trascending party politics causes conflict with the Representatives. He said that a reform of the Peers was indispensable to develop a democratic nation, and persuaded the House in question to declare that their first goal would be to pass a reform amendment in the current session. Cheers and applause came not only from the ruling Seiyukai, but also from the socialist Shakaito, from the liberal Minseito, and from other opposition parties that share that same goal. On the other hand, the speech's contents are spreading amongst the Peers, with anxiety and expectations surrounding the Diet."

The Upper House had become even more conservative than before the war, blocking various reforms that it considered as a threat to the national polity.\nHowever, it would be no exaggeration to say that the law just passed has significantly reduced the authority of the Peers, clearing the road towards liberalism.\n\nPrime Minister Yoshizawa has already declared that he will push for further reforms, and it's clear that Japan will push for a more liberal system."

So, Yoshizawa tried to revise the Upper House's ordinance by eliminating its influence, the biggest obstacle to liberalization, but his attempt seems to have failed due to strong opposition both within and without the Diet.\n\nDue to this, the Seiyukai has been abandoned by the liberals because of its lack of power, while conservatives expect that the Yoshizawa Cabinet, which has the Seiyukai's backing as the ruling party, will soon dissolve due to this serious setback in reformist policy."

Socialism was shunned for many years because of the belief it's incompatible with the kokutai (national polity), but partly due to its active cooperation in Fumimaro Konoe's Yokusan System, the party gained support from both the government and the people, with many former members of the Shakai Taishūtō coming out as candidates even after said system was put in place. However, exhausted by the Tojo Cabinet's post-war chaotic posture and economic turmoil, ex-party members began to work with other forces to overthrow him.\n\nWhen the Nihon Shakaitō formed after the dissolution of the Taisei Yokusankai, those expelled from the Shakai Taishūtō, as well as some former Yokusankai members, joined its ranks, allowing the party to field many respectable candidates in the 1946 election. Due to the gathering of a large number of people with various ideologies, loose \"Right\" and \"Left\" factions naturally emerged, succeeding in showing its presence in the House of Representatives as the fourth largest force.\n\nWhile supporting the liberal policies of the Matsumura Cabinet, the first post-war political government, the Shakaitō joined the Yokusan Kokuminkai in denouncing the Minseitō's and the Seiyūkai's austerity budget, proposed to repay national bonds. In the 1948 election, taking advantage of the loosening of election and speech control laws, the party backed the people arrested in the Popular Front and the Cabinet Planning Board incidents in order to further expand its support base and influence, but this cemented the presence of factions within the Shakaitō, while also radicalizing the leftist one. However, the party still succeeded in rising to third place due to dissatisfaction with the Minseitō and clamor for new ideas.\n\nThe Nihon Shakaitō is viewed as a threat by internal factions, public security forces, interest groups and conservatives, while steadily gaining workers'support; this party is attracting the most attention in both a good and a bad way. Currently, the party's Right is led by Inejiro Asanuma, active in worker movements since his school days, while the Left is led by Kanjū Katō, a pacifist arrested during the Popular Front Incident.

From late Taishō to early Shōwa, it existed within a two-party system alongside the Rikken Seiyūkai, electing Prime Ministers Reijirō Wakatsuki and Osachi Hamaguchi before the war, and Kenzo Matsumura after.\n\nAfter the end of political cabinets due to the May 15 Incident, the Minseitō had several ministers in the National Unity Cabinet, such as Saito, Okada, and Konoe, but due to its parliament-centered ideology, its confrontational stance with this Cabinet was ever-present. In particular, when the Konoe Cabinet made moves to establish the Taisei Yokusankai, party leader Chūji Machida threatened them with collapse by forcing all Minseitō ministers to resign. However, due to strong public opposition, the Rikken Minseitō was dissolved and its members integrated into the new coalition.\n\nEven among the other major political parties, the creation of the Yokusan System was strongly opposed, resulting in about half of the Minseitō candidates being elected without recommendation. So, more than half of the members of the new coalition were former Minseitō, questioning Prime Minister Tojo's concentration of power after the Greater East Asian War, many leaving the Yokusan Kokuminkai in favor of the dissident Gokoku Dōshikai.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Taisei Yokusankai after a \"21-year rule,'' former Imperial Diet members reconvened to form the Rikken Minseitō again. Chūji Machida was to be re-elected as its president, but due to his advanced age, Kenzo Matsumura was chosen instead. Despite the confusion of Machida's abrupt retirement, Matsumura gathered the support of anti-Taisei Yokusankai elements, successfully becoming the first party. The Matsumura Cabinet, the first political cabinet after the war, was formed, but problems piled up, chiefly inflation from excessive government bonds. Although it achieved some results in terms of liberalization, like women's suffrage in cooperation with the Shakaitō and the Seiyūkai. In terms of economic policy, due to excessive austerity and backlash from the opposition, domestic disparities widened and the economic turmoil couldn't be brought to an end.\n\nIn 1948, the House of Representatives was dissolved and a general election was launched in order to pass the Economic Policy Bill, but the result was a crushing defeat: the government fell to third place and surrendered power to the Seiyukai. As a result, it was considered necessary to reform the party leadership and reflect on past policies, but internal discussions worsened and, in the end, it was decided that young, 43-year-old Takeo Miki would be appointed as the new president as part of a rebranding strategy. However, this was a compromise between each of the party factions, with Miki himself prone to be influenced by them."

 ssw_jap_intro.4.d:0 "The Rikken Seiyūkai (Association of Friends of Constitutional Government) is the current ruling party, founded by Itō Hirobumi in 1900. The Seiyūkai has been leading party politics for many years and, even though it experienced several divisions, it can be said to be the most stable one on the political scene. The political party's philosophy is to be a \"statist party,'' placing top priority on the society and the nation, and gaining support from conservatives, like businessmen and landowners.\n\nFrom late Taishō to early Shōwa, the Seiyūkai found itself in a two-party system alongside the Rikken Minseitō, suffering a crushing defeat in the 1936 election under Kisaburō Suzuki and leading to its downfall. Since it was difficult to decide on Suzuki's successor, the party shifted to collective leadership. However, conflict between pro-military and pro-party politics members arose, dividing the Seiyūkai split into an \"orthodox\" faction, led by Ichirō Hatoyama, and a \"reform\" faction. Hatoyama appointed Fusanosuke Kuhara leader of the orthodox faction, trying and failing to mediate with the reformists. In the end, the Taisei Yokusankai was established, absorbing the split Seiyūkai with ease. Under the Yokusan System, reformist MPs joined pro-establishment political groups, while former \"orthodox\" faction members joined the rebellious Gokoku Dōshikai.\n\nAfter the Taisei Yokusankai was disbanded following a \"21-year rule\" before, during and after the Greater East Asia War, it was extremely difficult to reunite the Seiyūkai. In the overthrow the Tojo Cabinet, reformists had defended him, while orthodox MPs had joined in the attacks. Negotiator Tsuruhei Matsuno and non-aligned party members succeeded in re-establishing a unified Seiyūkai through their efforts. The 1946 elections, rife with the anti-militarism, failed to bring the party to power, but since the orthodox faction became mainstream, it succeeded in exerting a certain amount of influence over the Cabinet through unofficial cooperation with the Minseitō government. However, due to its opposition of the other party's economic policy, it often voted against budget proposals and economic laws. \n\nMinseitō Prime Minister Matsumura decided to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold an election in 1948, in an effort to weaken the Seiyūkai. Party leader Kenkichi Yoshizawa used his bureaucrat background to entice members of the Yokusan Kokuminkai to the Seiyūkai, getting Shigeru Yoshida and others to run under his banner. Thanks to this strategy, as well as the dissatisfaction with the Minseitō's economic policies, he succeeded in winning the election. This result changed the party quite a bit, leading to the formation of an internal bureaucrat faction, while Fusanosuke Kuhara, dissatisfied with the election strategy, joined the reformist faction.\n\nWhile following the Matsumura Cabinet's liberalization policy, Yoshizawa is aiming to turn Japan into an \"industrial powerhouse'' through aggressive fiscal spending, but these ideals can't be achieved without constantly keeping an eye on the diverse ​​Seiyūkai."

 ssw_jap.105.desc:0 "After revising the House of Peers, it was decided that a general election for a new administration would be held. The three most influential parties are the Rikken Seiyūkai, the Rikken Minseitō, and the Nihon Shakaitō; thanks to the upper house reform, the whole nation is paying attention to which political party will liberalize to what extent. Many expect the Seiyūkai to win a great number of seats in the House of Representatives due to Kenkichi Yoshizawa's recent achievement. If they manage to stay in power, a new prime minister will surely be elected from their ranks. The Minseitō has replaced the old leader Kenzo Matsumura, who failed to reform the Peers in the past, with 46-year-old Takeo Miki. If this party wins, the latter will be their first prime minister, as well as the youngest to hold the title since Ito Hirobumi. On the other hand, there's also the Nihon Shakaitō, which has been gaining traction since the war ended: with the upper house reformed, they decided to elect the leftist Mosaburo Suzuki as their leader. If the Shakaitō gains power, some expect they'll implement radically socialist policies."
