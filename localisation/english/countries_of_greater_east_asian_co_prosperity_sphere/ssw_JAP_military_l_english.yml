 JAP_Organize_Well:0 "Organize Well"
 JAP_Organize_Well_desc:0 "An established chain of command, like the German one in World War II, makes advanced and simple battlefield operations, such as the Blitzkrieg, possible.

 JAP_End_of_Disarmament:0 "End the disarmament"
 JAP_End_of_Disarmament_desc:0 "The age of disarmament and reducing the size of our military is over, marking a new beginning for our forces. The Japanese army shall evolve and develop to adapt to the present, turning into a first-class army suitable as the sword and shield of the Empire."

 JAP_Lesson_from_Ministry_of_Muntions_desc:0 "During World War II, the Ministry of Munitions had a great influence on the production of war material.

 JAP_Moblilisation_Reservists:0 "Mobilize the Reserves"
 JAP_Moblilisation_Reservists_desc:0 "Under the previous disarmament policy, many soldiers still able to fight in active duty were sent into reserve roles. Letting them slack off would be a shame.

 JAP_Increased_Administrative_Cost_for_Warships:0 "Increase warship management costs"
 JAP_Increased_Administrative_Cost_for_Warships_desc:0 "Even with old warships, many can still be used in battle if repaired. By investing large amounts of funds into their maintenance, it'll be possible to immediately deploy our naval forces, reserves included, in case of an unforeseen emergency."
 JAP_More_Naval_Land_Forces:0 "Expand our naval landing forces"
 JAP_More_Naval_Land_Forces_desc:0 "The Imperial Japanese Marines achieved great results during World War II.

 JAP_Increase_in_budget_of_Navy_and_Army_desc:0 "The Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of the Army were forced into unfavorable times, with all the budget cuts caused by disarmament.

 JAP_Increased_Military_Industry:0 "Revitalize the military industry"
 JAP_Increased_Military_Industry_desc:0 "We have many companies participating in the munitions industry, but it's doubtful that all of them are profitable. Still, it would be a shame to let them go. Actively revitalizing the munitions industry and protecting its companies will lead to more military industrial growth."
 JAP_Mass_Assult_by_Tank:0 "Mass Tank Assault"
 JAP_Mass_Assult_by_Tank_desc:0 "During the German-Soviet War, assaults with large numbers of tanks were seen on both sides.

 JAP_Ship_Across_the_Pacific:0 "Ships across the Pacific"
 JAP_Ship_Across_the_Pacific_desc:0 "With the Greater East Asia War and the subsequent collapse of the United States, the Imperial Japanese Navy is now the ruler of the Pacific. As long as we own that vast ocean, having long-range ships able to go anywhere is essential."

 JAP_Mechanisation_Imperial_Army:0 "The IJA Mechanization Project"
 JAP_Mechanisation_Imperial_Army_desc:0 "In modern battlefields, armored vehicle transportation is becoming more widespread than marching on foot.

 JAP_Magnificent_Imperial_army:0 "A magnificent Imperial Army"
 JAP_Magnificent_Imperial_army_desc:0 "The Imperial Army has become far more powerful than it was before the Greater East Asia War, disarmament acting as a spring.

 JAP_land_sea_sky_desc:0 "Times change, and battlefields change along with them. The Imperial Army should also evolve further to keep up in all environments of land, sea, and air. Let us make sure that groundwork is prepared first, so as to respond to new kinds of war."
 JAP_Air_Force_Create:0 "Establish the Imperial Japanese Air Force"
 JAP_Air_Force_Create_desc:0 "Air warfare is no longer as important as land and naval warfare on its own, and leaving the Army in control of the airforce can leave us behind.

 JAP_Protect_the_Route_desc:0 "For Japan, securing routes for transport and commercial ships is an essential condition for war, and it's no exaggeration to say that the destroyers that escort the convoys en-route are the most important force within our Navy.

 JAP_We_must_Protect_Empire:0 "Protect every corner of the Empire"
 JAP_We_must_Protect_Empire_desc:0 "Under our consolidated command of the sea, the Japanese mainland becomes a sanctuary that can never be violated by the enemy.

 JAP_Fuji_Fire_Drill:0 "Fuji Fire Drills"
 JAP_Fuji_Fire_Drill_desc:0 "Within the Imperial Japanese Army, special large-scale exercises have been conducted since 1890, and they should be done again.

 JAP_Chemical_Warfare_desc:0 "In war, only three types of weapons, known as \"Weapons of Mass Destruction\" (or WMD for short), are extremely powerful against enemies: nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
