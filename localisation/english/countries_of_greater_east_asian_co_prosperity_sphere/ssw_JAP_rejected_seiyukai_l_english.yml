 ssw_jap.300.t:0 "Kuhara's responsibilities"
 ssw_jap.300.d:0 "The split Seiyukai still held on to the number of seats needed to remain the ruling party, electing Fusanosuke Kuhara as the new Prime Minister, but the number of people leaving the party is still increasing, rather than the opposite happening. Also, since Kuhara is busy with the party's division, national affairs have been neglected, and popular support is dropping rapidly. People questioning Kuhara's abilities in this situation have appeared both within and without the Seiyukai, with talks about a vote of no confidence against the Cabinet. Opposition parties like the Shakaito and the Kokuminkai have put up anti-Cabinet posters in the city, anti-Kuhara speeches are receiving a lot of praise, and newspapers publish statements about the impending end of the current administration on their front pages."
 ssw_jap.300.a:0 "What the hell have I done?"
 ssw_jap.301.t:0 "New decisions"
 ssw_jap.301.d:0 "Prime Minister Kuhara is one step closer to resigning in response to criticism coming from all sides, and to a party strategy that hasn't produced any results. However, by giving up here, the efforts to maintain the Seiyukai in power would've all been for naught. Still, it's undeniable that continuing on this line could have an irreparably serious impact on the administration and the Seiyukai. Having spent the whole night in his office, Kuhara finally came to a decision."
 ssw_jap.301.a:0 "Fight for the government"
 ssw_jap.301.b:0 "Resign from the Cabinet"
 ssw_jap.302.t:0 "The Seiyukai's initiative"
 ssw_jap.302.d:0 "Good news, everyone! A series of strategies employed by Kuhara, like negotiations and intra-party reforms, finally succeeded in stopping the flow of people leaving the Seiyukai. However, many still blame him for neglecting national affairs and failing to stop the crisis earlier; there are also suspicions that Kuhara bribed several members to prevent them from leaving. Even if Kuhara were to resign now, the Seiyukai still has enough seats to elect a new Prime Minister. Should Kuhara do just that, handing over the administration to his colleague Ichiro Hatoyama?"
 ssw_jap.302.a:0 "Ichiro Hatoyama is elected!"
 ssw_jap.302.b:0 "Fusanosuke Kuhara for PM!"
 ssw_jap.303.t:0 "Innovation Alliance victory"
 ssw_jap.303.d:0 "With Kuhara's resignation, the Seiyukai couldn't stop its collapse, so Chikuhei Nakajima, leader of the new Innovation Alliance party, was elected Prime Minister. It's expected that his administration will mostly employ former Seiyukai innovationists, and will also enact a new military policy. In his inauguration speech, he declared that he'll bring unemployment down, create a new Japanese economy by re-expanding the munitions industry, promising a strong regime to counter the threats of communism and fascism."

 ssw_jap.304.t:0 "A conservative coalition?"
 ssw_jap.304.d:0 "Conservative voters are starting to support other parties one after another due to the missteps of the current administration. There are some of our colleagues who are concerned about this, saying that the conservative parties should reunite. Not a lot of time has passed since the Seiyukai and the Innovation Alliance split, and they still insist on the same policies, so them combining would be easier. Also, for voters who think that conservative parties pursue only their own interests, it'll be possible to think about new ideas together."

 ssw_jap.305.t:0 "The Seyukai-Innovation Alliance meeting"
 ssw_jap.305.d:0 "It's finally time to move towards a merger! Representatives of the Seiyukai and the Innovation Alliance gathered together to start talks about the formation of a new party. Although different opinions came up during the meeting, there were some points that both sides could agree on. The first was to come up with a completely new name, being neither Seiyukai nor Innovation Alliance. The main purpose is to make the new party appealing to the people. The other was \"minponshugi\", which claims that the people are at the center of politics, and sovereignty lies with the emperor, a compromise notion between a traditional Japanese value, and a principle suitable for future politics."
 ssw_jap.305.a:0 "Let's talk"
 ssw_jap.306.t:0 "Formation of the Jiyuu Minpon-to"
 ssw_jap.306.d:0 "Today, the formation of a new political party was declared! Its name is the \"Jiyuu Minpon-to\" (Liberal-Democratic Party), and it advocates a new way of conservatism in the defense of liberalism and \"minponshugi\". Takeru Inukai, having played an active role as bridge between the two constituent parties, was appointed as the first leader. Many former Seiyukai and Innovation Alliance members participated in this new party, with some new ones coming from the Shakaito and the Minseito. The people are very interested on how Japanese politics will change with this new player on the field, while the opposition is wary."
