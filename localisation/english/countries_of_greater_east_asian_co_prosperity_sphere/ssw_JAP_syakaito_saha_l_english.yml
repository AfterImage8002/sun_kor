 JAP_syakaito_saha_route:0 "Left Shakaito Focus Tree"
 JAP_the_challenge_of_the_socialist_party:0 "The Challenge of Syakaito"
 JAP_the_challenge_of_the_socialist_party_desc:0 "The time has finally come! We, the party of the proletariat, have won. In the past, we were treated as dangerous elements by the police and the Kempeitai, but now we have His Majesty's approval and a majority in the Diet. This is both a historical change and a starting point for the Empire's transformation. We aren't allowed to fail now, let's achieve progress and prosperity at all costs!"
 JAP_economic_liberation:0 "Economic Liberation"
 JAP_economic_liberation_desc:0 "In the Empire, countless workers and farmers are still exploited by businessmen and landowners. We shall start a battle to bring this reactionary economic structure to an end."
 JAP_freedom_for_the_workers:0 "Freedom for the Workers!"
 JAP_freedom_for_the_workers_desc:0 "Workers are the cornerstone of our nation, as nothing can be done without them. It should be in everyone's interest to remedy the oppressive situation they are in, giving them freedom and bringing further prosperity to Japan."
 JAP_control_of_tradeunions:0 "Regulate the labor union"
 JAP_control_of_tradeunions_desc:0 "Worker liberation is an important issue in the Japanese economy, but it has no reason to become a cause for disrupting the social order. Some labor unions have made radical claims that could lead to riots and violent strikes: we must keep them under police surveillance."
 JAP_workers_rights:0 "Workers' Rights"
 JAP_workers_rights_desc:0 "While most landowners and businessmen can only think of their own interests and are hungry for profit, their employees are exploited, but their hard work brings many benefits to the Empire, making them its greatest contributors. Isn't their plight absurd? We must work with the labor unions to improve their treatment."
 JAP_start_of_the_social_democratic_struggle:0 "Start the Social Democratic Struggle"
 JAP_start_of_the_social_democratic_struggle_desc:0 "Social democracy was born in Europe before World War I, having experienced two global conflicts and many internal ones. Japanese social democracy has faced many hardships as well and, although it almost perished on more than one occasion, its flame never went out, continuing to grow day by day. We will start a battle to illuminate Japan, and the entirety of East Asia, with this flame!"
 JAP_the_fight_against_conservatism:0 "Fight the Conservative"
 JAP_the_fight_against_conservatism_desc:0 "Some conservatives call us communists and threats against the national polity, which is just not true. Conservatism is hindering progress within the Empire, causing the rise of the dangerous forces who really want to destroy the national polity. Not defeating them now is going to have a serious impact on the Empire."
 JAP_claims_of_anti_communism:0 "Anti-Communist Claim"
 JAP_claims_of_anti_communism_desc:0 "Aren't the Communists the ones who damage our reputation the most? many ask. By denying such allegations and adopting an anti-communist stance, it will be possible to convey our true intentions to the people."
 JAP_reflecting_on_the_past:0 "Look to the past"
 JAP_reflecting_on_the_past_desc:0 "Social democracy in Japan has experienced many hardships, repeatedly making compromises and cooperating to avoid repression by those in power. Shouldn't our laws take these experiences into account and reflect them now that we're finally in control?"
 JAP_towards_an_emperor_socialism:0 "To Imperial Socialism"
 JAP_towards_an_emperor_socialism_desc:0 "There's still a deep-rooted prejudice among many Japanese that socialism is an horrifying and anti-monarchic ideology. We must overcome this and the reactionary forces inciting attacks against us, and achieve Imperial Socialism."
 JAP_people_of_greater_east_asia:0 "People of Greater East Asia"
 JAP_people_of_greater_east_asia_desc:0 "There are hundreds of millions of people living in the Asian countries we've liberated. Japan, leader of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the world's largest faction, is responsible for ensuring their happiness. It will be necessary to devote a lot of wealth and effort to fulfill this expectation."
 JAP_right_to_life:0 "Right to Live"
 JAP_right_to_life_desc:0 "\"Everyone has the right to live a healthy and culturally fulfilling life.\" This motto is the basis of our views on social security, and symbolizes a policy that will protect the right to life with legal provisions."
 JAP_increased_humanitarian_aid:0 "Increase Humanitarian Aid"
 JAP_increased_humanitarian_aid_desc:0 "East Asian co-prosperity won't be achieved by just focusing on domestic matters. The socialist spirit of sharing our wealth could take the form of international humanitarian aid."
 JAP_organisation_of_the_greater_east_asia_socialist_conference:0 "Hold the Greater East Asia Socialist Conference"
 JAP_organisation_of_the_greater_east_asia_socialist_conference_desc:0 "Prior to the Greater East Asia War, repression by western powers and feudal landowners was widespread. However, the latter still exist in areas we liberated, while some corrupt elements in the Japanese army continue to exploit our new brethren. Invite social democrats from various East Asian countries in order to counter this exploitation, and host a grand conference in Japan to condemn the reactionary forces. It's time to hold the \"Great East Asia Socialist Conference\"!"
 JAP_joint_condemnation_of_china:0 "Joint Statement of Condemnation of China"
 JAP_joint_condemnation_of_china_desc:0 "It's now common knowledge that China has disrupted East Asia's prosperity and co-prosperity, and is plotting to invade to monopolize its wealth. In recent years, it has gradually become more aggressive and many of our allies are worried. We can't give in to China. Let us raise a loud chorus of criticism."
 JAP_establishment_of_the_social_insurance_agency:0 "Establish the Social Insurance Agency"
 JAP_establishment_of_the_social_insurance_agency_desc:0 "Our social security system grows with each passing day, with fiscal spending increasing accordingly. As this bloated system requires an organization to control it, we'll set up a Social Insurance Agency."
 JAP_more_than_a_political_fraternity:0 "More than the Seiyukai"
 JAP_more_than_a_political_fraternity_desc:0 "During the 1947 elections, the Seiyukai proposed a social security policy similar to that of the Shakaito, even though the two parties were in opposition. This seemed to work, as it helped them regain power. However, that proposal was, after all, a counterfeit to our original, toned down to suit their needs. In order to let the people know, we should provide them with better social security than the Seiyukai."
 JAP_advanced_welfare:0 "Progressive Welfare"
 JAP_advanced_welfare_desc:0 "Social democratic governments all over the world have been advocating for advanced welfare policies one after another. But among these, many failed, like the British attempt. We will learn from their mistakes and establish an advanced and unique Japanese welfare."
 JAP_hope_for_democratisation:0 "Hope towards Democratisation"
 JAP_hope_for_democratisation_desc:0 "In the term Social Democracy, the word \"democracy\" is as important as the word \"socialism\". Society can't progress with an outdated and authoritarian political system. However, it's also wrong to turn into an society that oppresses its people, like in the former Soviet Union. We must democratize, strongly hoping and firmly willing to do it correctly."
 JAP_promotion_of_public_works:0 "Promote Public Works"
 JAP_promotion_of_public_works_desc:0 "Public works can eliminate economic stagnation by force, and give a job to many. The zaibatsu and some capitalists claim that they hinder fair competition, but such initiatives certainly have a positive impact on society at large. An almost-two-year plan will be carried out based on this."
 JAP_reforming_the_death_penalty:0 "Reform Capital Punishment"
 JAP_reforming_the_death_penalty_desc:0 "The death penalty is cruel, and has many an ethical issue. However, it's also true that many want it to stay. Our administration considers its abolition as the final goal, but considering the divided public opinion, death penalty will apply only for the crime of treason."
 JAP_the_concept_of_direct_democracy:0 "Envision Direct Democracy"
 JAP_the_concept_of_direct_democracy_desc:0 "Under our current system, a Cabinet can only be dissolved after the House of Representatives election, held once every four years, or by His Majesty's decree. The latter method has no precedent, and it's unlikely that it ever will. Still, this is an issue, as it can lead to a militaristic regime. So, we will propose for the House of Representatives and the Cabinet to only be dissolved, outside of the natural four years,  by means of a referendum."
 JAP_confrontation_with_the_house_of_lords:0 "Deal with the House of Peers"
 JAP_confrontation_with_the_house_of_lords_desc:0 "The House of Peers is made up of unelected Kazoku and large taxpayers and from its very beginning it had a history of rejecting the House of Representatives' proposals. Former Prime Minister Yoshizawa succeeded in amending their ordinance, but it's still not enough. This insitution, which doesn't reflect popular will, is a major obstacle to democracy and must be reformed. Even if it creates conflict..."
 JAP_planned_industrialisation:0 "Planned Industrialization"
 JAP_planned_industrialisation_desc:0 "Since the zaibatsu and the capitalists create serious disparities and devour profits, industrialization needs to be promoted systematically and efficiently by the central government. The Soviet Union's Five-year Plans and the United States' New Deal made great progress in this regard. Japan shall follow their example!!"
 JAP_construction_of_dams:0 "Dam Construction"
 JAP_construction_of_dams_desc:0 "Dams supply large amounts of electricity to urban areas, greatly help prevent floods, and contribute significantly towards employment. As Japan has many mountainous areas, we can build many of them. Some local residents will have to be evicted for this project to happen, but it's a sacrifice we're willing to make."
 JAP_join_the_left:0 "Side with the Left"
 JAP_join_the_left_desc:0 "Although Mosaburo Suzuki is part of the Left Shakaito, he had to compromise with the Right faction in order to maintain party unity. But now that our policies have proven successful, no such thing is needed anymore. From now on, we'll move at full speed towards the ideals of the left!"
 JAP_cooperation_with_the_right:0 "Cooperate with the Right"
 JAP_cooperation_with_the_right_desc:0 "The Shakaito keeps having serious factional struggles, with party unity so fragile that it could collapse at any moment. In order to avoid the worst-case scenario, we must continue cooperation with the Right Shakaito and become stronger."
 JAP_young_man_do_not_take_up_your_gun_again:0 "Young men, do not take up arms!"
 JAP_young_man_do_not_take_up_your_gun_again_desc:0 "Prime Minister Suzuki has finally decided to break the taboo. The spirit shown by our young in the Greater East Asia War was inspiring, but the devastation, those killed on the Southern Front, and the East Asian countries in ruins, those were terrible. Our intention not to relive these painful events will become the words \"Young men, do not take up arms!\", and echo throughout Japanese society!"
 JAP_memories_of_takao_saito:0 "Memory of Takao Saito"
 JAP_memories_of_takao_saito_desc:0 "Takao Saito is a politician known for his legendary Anti-military Speech, given in the face of increasing military influence before the war. His speech caused an uproar in the Diet and, although he was ousted from his position of MP, Saito succeeded in asserting his antimilitarist and liberal ideals. Isn't his attitude something to be emulated? We'll also blame the military and its political collaborators."
 JAP_protection_of_the_souhyou:0 "Protect the Sohyo"
 JAP_protection_of_the_souhyou_desc:0 "The Sohyo (short for General Council of Trade Unions of Japan) is a national organization of labor unions which announced its support for the Shakaito. It continues to grow with each passing day, with the presence of union votes being of considerable importance during a campaign. Many of its members support the Left Shakaito, but some also have rather radical ideas, like their rumored connection with the communist Nihon Kyosanto. Protecting the Sohyo should lead to more support on their part, and more workers' rights."
 JAP_intensifying_confrontation_with_conservative_forces:0 "Intensify the fight against the conservatives"
 JAP_intensifying_confrontation_with_conservative_forces_desc:0 "As our policies rapidly progress, conservative-reactionaries complain about the \"destruction of the national polity\" at the hands of the \"Red traitors\". Besides the fact we're a legitimate government appointed by His Majesty the Emperor, their criticism is completely baseless. They hinded the progress of Japanese society, and must be crushed."
 JAP_calling_all_korean_workers:0 "Call on the Korean Worker"
 JAP_calling_all_korean_workers_desc:0 "The number of Koreans in mainland Japan increases every year, even as they face a lot of discrimination and financial hardships coming here in search of better wages. We should re-establish Naisen Ittai (unity with Korea), as we did during the war, and insist on improving all workers' rights."
 JAP_pro_communist:0 "Acceptance of Communism"
 JAP_pro_communist_desc:0 "The Nihon Kyosanto, currently regarded as an illegal political party, has announced with the \"Nosaka Declaration\" their willingness to reconsider the abolition of the imperial system an to abandon violent revolution. If the communists plan to become more moderate from now on, we must help them. We'll continue to monitor their ranks, but let's also try to negotiate."
 JAP_peaceful_revolution:0 "Peaceful Revolution!"
 JAP_peaceful_revolution_desc:0 "The revolution came peacefully! Our socialist economic policies were successful, and we came very close to political pacifism. Many challenges still await us, but peace and prosperity brought by socialism will triumph over everything!"
 JAP_learning_from_the_uk:0 "Learn from the Brits"
 JAP_learning_from_the_uk_desc:0 "The UK is implementing a compehensive welfare policy under the Labor Party, \"from the cradle to the grave.\" It has saved many from poverty, but has also led to a decline in work motivation. Let's thoroughly study their ideas and find a social security suitable for Japan."
 JAP_about_social_security:0 "Social security"
 JAP_about_social_security_desc:0 "It's of utmost importance for party unity to gather opinions from both Right and Left Shakaito to decide our policies. Thus, it's also necessary to proceed this way about social security. This should give us more insight on the party's stance."
 JAP_questions_to_kawakami:0 "Questioning Kawakami"
 JAP_questions_to_kawakami_desc:0 "A meeting between Jotaro Kawakami, Right Shakaito leader, and Mosaburo Suzuki, Left Shakaito head, will symbolize party harmony best. Kawakami also seems enthusiastic about this, with full unity within the Shakaito rapidly approaching."
 JAP_reconciliation_between_the_classes:0 "Class reconciliation"
 JAP_review_of_war_strategy:0 "Review our war plans"
 JAP_review_of_war_strategy_desc:0 "Our foreign policy focuses on pacifism, but ideals alone can't protect us and our allies. Of course, we'll stay pacifist, but it's also necessary to reconsider our war plans and work to restore our sour relations with the military."
 JAP_expose_the_communists:0 "Expose the Communists"
 JAP_expose_the_communists_desc:0 "Relations between the communists and the Left Shakaito were complicated. There have been fierce conflicts between communism and social democracy, but when the Kyosanto came up with the Nosaka Declaration as their appeasement policy, some within our party were confused. However, they're still communists and no matter how much they hide it, they're against the national polity. Now it's time to mass-arrest them. This complicated relationship should be broken."
