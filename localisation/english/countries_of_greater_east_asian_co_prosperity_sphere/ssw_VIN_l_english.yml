The Emperor spread words of gratitude and congratulations to his subjects via radio and, while some were elated by the message, others looked back with pessimism at the war that had just ended. At the same time, preparations towards reconstruction were steadily progressing, the Vietnamese not having time to take a break even after the conflict.\n\nBy the time unification came about, lots of blood flowed and lands were scorched, but the people's morale remained high. As long as they keep that spirit up, Vietnam will continue to survive and rebuild."

 SSW_VIN.30.d:0 "We have unified Vietnam and now have the war leaders of North Vietnam in custody, but there's an ongoing dispute within the government, judiciary, and military about the fate of the commanders of the North Vietnamese army (the Vietnamese National Revolutionary Army).\n\nThe harshest option is that those who were in charge of the North's army should receive a punishment of some kind and sent to re-education camps. On the other hand, some moderates claim the Vietnamese morale and unity to be most important: thus, all prisoners should be pardoned, and part of them could even work inside our military. Other proposals are a mixture of the two above.\n\nThis issue is unavoidable if we wish to rebuild Vietnam, and we must choose carefully."

 SSW_VIN.31.d:0 "The rise of the Viet Minh is becoming a bigger issue by the day, threatening the stability of the government and the nation. Various opinions are forming about this impossible-to-ignore organization, while controversies often arise within the government about what stance to adopt towards them. It seems that the time has come for the Emperor to decide whether to hold a cabinet meeting to resolve the situation."

 SSW_VIN.32.d:0 "That day, the Council of Ministers' agenda was more serious than usual, making many heads hurt. The agricultural crisis, as well as the Viet Minh issue, made everyone uneasy, wondering what kind of report would be given. Within this unpleasant atmosphere, Deputy Prime Minister Buu Loc opened his mouth to speak: \"The Viet Minh are intensifying their offensive day by day. The Imperial Army's security forces are busy dealing with them, but their momentum shows no sign of slowing down. Their terrorist attack here in Saigon last week shows that there are very few places outside of their reach within Vietnam.\"\n\nAs everyone expected, the situation was bad. In particular, Security Minister Phan Van Giao appeared clearly frustrated, remembering that the security forces he had organized were also destroyed by them.\n\nInside that bad atmosphere, Emperor Bao Dai, who had until that moment just smoked and listened, made an unprecedented and strange proposal, unusual for him as he rarely spoke during those meetings. \"Why don't we try to win them over instead of fighting them?\" All the ministers were stunned, remaining silent for some time.\n\nIt was Phan Van Giao who first opened his mouth: \"Then what have we been fighting for!? We didn't get this far just to negiotiate with communists! Has even His Majesty fallen in love with Ho Chi Minh?\".\n\n\"Ehi! Is that the way to speak to the Emperor! His Majesty has wisely proposed these negotiations for the sake of our people!\" Buu Loc quickly criticized. After that, the argument continued for a long time and, after a much-needed break, a conclusion was reached during the next meeting."

 SSW_VIN.33.d:0 "The decision made after the Council of Ministers was to negotiate with the Viet Minh. Said group was very confused by this, but in the end embraced their feelings of anticipation and distrust, and agreed to sit down at the negotiating table. On the way, a warning was received from the Empire of Japan's 38th Army headquarters, but the meeting still took place.\n\nThe Viet Minh delegation brought along a \"message from Ho Chi Minh\", which began by praising Vietnamese unity and the attitude that brought to the negotiations. Then, the specific demands and compromises were read out:\n\n・ the Viet Minh won't force a socialist regime\n・ Bao Dai's position will be preserved\n・ the Viet Minh must be allowed to participate in government\n・ the Viet Minh army will be integrated\n・ withdrawal from the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\n・ nationalization of Japanese assets\n\nIf we were to accept their proposals, things could result in a military intervention due to the hostile stance we would take towards Japan. The final say was Bao Dai's. We must choose carefully, as this will change the fate of Vietnam."

Also, some of that intel was linked to conspiracies, like plans of a coup and rumors of riots, making the situation extremely complex.\n\nNgo Dinh Nhu had no time to rest, his mind occupied by reports of military officers and investigators, as well as from issuing command after command. Also, due to the spreading conspiracies, the fear that enemies may be lurking inside the intelligence office put even more pressure on him. We must overcome this situation as soon as possible. At least, Ngo Dinh Nhu sincerely hopes so."

 SSW_VIN.35.d:0 "Due the Viet Minh attacks, Deputy Prime Minister Buu Loc felt nervous, sweating every time he read each catastrophic report. Even if he told the Emperor, the fact that he almost always got sent back with a vague reply put more pressure on the politician.\n\nLike usual, a man had come to visit Buu Loc while he was stressed by work and a Viet Minh-caused headache. It was Nguyen Van Tam, Head of Security in the capital of Saigon. As soon as he sat down to discuss, he brought up a deal offer: he would solve the problem that was afflicting the Deputy Prime Minister in exchange for more authority in security-related matters.\n\nNguyen Van Tam had certainly done well as Saigon's Head of Security. Buu Loc, tired of having to work so much, agreed to increase his authority."

The enormous amount of money, coming from the national treasury and Bao Dai himself, and given to craftsmen and engineers following their demands, were used for experiments which resulted in the creation of many luxury goods and new businesses.\n\nBeautifully embroidered Ao dai, pottery created over a long period of time, and high-quality coffee beans produced through repeated experiments have gained a lot of praise from overseas, with orders constantly coming in from Japanese capitalists."

 SSW_VIN.39.d:0 "The Bao Dai administration, continuing to lead Vietnam, finds itself at a milestone.

 SSW_VIN.40.t:0 "Bad Rumors"
 SSW_VIN.40.d:0 "After his usual night out, a wasted Bao Dai went back to his palace and got some peaceful sleep, but his awakening turned out to be much noisier. When a servant told him a guest was waiting for him, Bao Dai reluctantly dressed up and decided to meet this person. It was none other than Nguyen Van Tam, who mercilessly crushed the enemies of the Imperial government.\n\nHe told Bao Dai that his security forces alerted him of disturbing signs within the administration: specifically, his intel said that Deputy Prime Minister Buu Loc was trying to reduce the emperor's powers and take control of the cabinet himself.\n\nBao Dai was confused by the story, which seemed too crazy to be true, but Nguyen Van Tam was too much of an expert to needlessly suspect someone. Having told him this, Van Tam returned home immediately, leaving Bao Dai with deepening doubts."

 SSW_VIN.41.t:0 "Vision"
 SSW_VIN.41.d:0 "Deputy Prime Minister Phuc Buu Loc, other than being a relative of Bao Dai, also had his confidence, the two often exchanging opinions regarding policies as well as other matters. Buu Loc was very proud to have achieved stability for both Bao Dai's and Vietnam's positions, the beautiful relationship between the two feeling ready for the final touches.\n\nThat day, Buu Loc talked to Bao Dai about the future: restoring the good old Vietnamese politics of the past, with a merciful leader leading his subjects from the imperial court. Bao Dai felt fascinated by his story, becoming more and more eager for political influence."
 SSW_VIN.41.a:0 "Interesting"
 SSW_VIN.42.t:0 "Trouble"
 SSW_VIN.42.d:0 "The rumors of rebellion heard the other day from Nguyen Van Tam circulated in Bao Dai's head, who felt trapped by his thoughts. Thinking it was about time to make a decision, he decided to interrogate the two parties separately.\n\nAs expected, Buu Loc denied the rumors, claiming it was a plot by the bloodthirsty Nguyen Van Tam, who instead insisted the Deputy PM - as well as anyone involved in the plot - be dismissed or arrested through the issuing of an imperial edict.\n\nBao Dai, caught between the two claims, has to make a decision."

 SSW_VIN.43.t:0 "Imperial Edict"
 SSW_VIN.43.d:0 "Bao Dai finally decided. It was a painful decision, but an edict ordering the dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Buu Loc and the arrest of his supporters was issued. The operation entrusted to Nguyen Van Tam, military personnel and police officers entered court and parliament and took their targets away by car one after another.\n\nHowever, Bao Dai made a mistake. Giving orders to exempt Buu Loc from arrest, the former Deputy PM still got taken into custody. When he angrily asked about the matter, Van Tam explained: \"He's a traitor, who will one day hurt His Majesty himself. As a loyal subject, I can't overlook this.\"\n\nBao Dai tried to dismiss Nguyen Van Tam in response, but it was too late. All intelligence, military, and security organizations were now under his control. If he issued an edict, it would be intercepted immediately and, even if it were received, any opposition to Van Tam would be wiped out through overwhelming military power. There was no way for Bao Dai to act anymore. Now, he could only sit on his throne as Nguyen Van Tam's puppet."
 SSW_VIN.43.a:0 "It was all too late"
 SSW_VIN.44.t:0 "Abuse of Power"
 SSW_VIN.44.d:0 "Buu Loc was trustworthy and he would never betray him. Bao Dai's decision seems to have been the correct one: thinking Nguyen Van Tam suspicious instead, he investigated him independently, finding numerous instances of corruption and powergrabbing. Moreover, he tried to manipulate Bao Dai and abuse his powers, which prompted the Emperor to think about improving the current system.\n\nSo, it was decided to issue an imperial edict, delegating a fair amount of authority to the loyal Deputy PM and his aides. Buu Loc was moved by the proclamation, thinking it time to put the vision he once talked to Bao Dai about into practice."

The cell door of the leader of the party's right wing, Vu Hong Khanh, opened and he was taken by the guards to a large room, where they had him sit down on a chair placed behind a table. Opposite him sat Prime Minister Nguyen Van Tam, currently the highest authority within Vietnam, which surprised the other somewhat.\n\nVan Tam briefly told Vu that, in exchange for legalizing the VNQDD, he and the other restored party members would have to help him destroy the Viet Minh. Vu Hong Khanh, finding an opportunity to turn from prisoner to party leader and play an active role in Vietnam again, accepted the fascinating proposal without hesitation."

Buu Loc, watching the drunk Bao Dai from a distance, felt relieved that Vietnam's and the Emperor's positions were once again secure, bringing to his mouth a glass of delicate wine in celebration."

 SSW_VIN.47.d:0 "As expected, the announcement about Christianization pushed the Buddhists, who had been dissatisfied for some time, over the edge. Protests are now erupting in various areas, their symbol being the six-colored Buddhist flag. Many faithful, not to mention monks, agree with this sentiment and, although the number of demonstrators increases every day, there have been no noticeable fights yet, as the government seems to be waiting for the situation to subside.\n\nStill, we mustn't let our guards down. It's necessary to instruct the police of each region to establish an around-the-clock security system, while preparing to deploy the army in case of emergency."

The incident has also ignited the wrath of many Buddhists, with hunger strikes occurring in various places. Attracting particular attention was the case of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc, who doused his body with gasoline and committed suicide by self-immolation.\n\nThis series of incidents has been reported all over the world due to the presence of Buddhist refugees. Even the Japanese, holding great sway over our nation, have expressed their disapproval.\n\nThe situation is only getting worse: the army has clean rifles, large amounts of bullets, even chemical weapons as a last resort. Now is time to order the troops to deploy, ending this riots by any means necessary and bringing the word of God to Vietnam."

 SSW_VIN.49.d:0 "That day, a group of Vietnamese Imperial Army Special Forces was, for the purpose of keeping security, in front of a temple on the outskirts of Saigon, glaring at the Buddhist monks. A few hours earlier, one of their superior informed them: \"We suspect this temple is hiding rebels.\" These soldiers, whose job was to root out opposition, were deployed on that day with this same purpose.\n\nThe situation changed suddenly. From the large crowd gathered, a bullet flew out. In response, a bloody fight ensued, most of the crowd and monks fleeing into the temple.\n\nAfter shooting all who resisted, the rest was simple. The flamethrowers burned down everything within the temple. Many ran away screaming, but some, emulating Thich Quang Duc, assumed the lotus position within the burning flames and continued their last stand."

 SSW_VIN.50.d:0 "Ngo Dinh Diem has finally made a bold decision against the continued Buddhist resistance: he will issue an order to crush the protesters using all the power available to the army and the police.\n\nAfter this decision, the security forces stopped acting for a while, making plans for simultaneous suppression and preparing equipment. In the eerie silence before the storm, Buddhists placed sandbags and held poorly-handmade weapons in anticipation for the coming assault.\n\nMeanwhile, the army's top brass was making all kinds of plans of action while looking at maps of the area, NCOs and soldiers checked their weapons, and the last resort - chemical weapons - was being taken out of a strictly-guarded warehouse."

 SSW_VIN.51.t:0 "Buddhist Resistance Intensifies"
 SSW_VIN.51.d:0 "The Buddhists have set up defenses far exceeding our expectations, which in turn increased their morale. No matter how much of them we attack and arrest, their numbers continue to grow and their activities get stronger and stronger.\n\nMany have fallen at the hands of chemical weapons, but with our Buddhists soldiers leaking intel in advance, it seems many cases of sabotaged armaments have taken place.\n\nIn addition, with rumors of an assassination plan against Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem spreading, some have suggested that it would be more important to draft countermeasures for the crisis than to strengthen our offensive."

 SSW_VIN.53.d:0 "Due to our decision to restructure the government's defensive and offensive strategies, the clashes with the demonstrators have become a back-and-forth, making us lose sight of a conclusion to this situation once again.

Fighting off the mob and leaving for the location, a few kilometers away from the city of Saigon, one of the special forces soldiers, assigned inside the car during the escort mission, fired his rifle at the back of the Prime Minister's head.\n\nSince the culprit shot himself after killing another soldier of the escort team, any connection between his motives and any rebel organizations remains completely unknown."

Citing these reasons, others are of the opinion that we should maintain the Front in order to achieve unification in the true sense of the word.

With the coalition scattered, each of its members held talks with the other political forces in search of a new affiliation, creating new parties and making it clear to all that it won't be long before a new system is in place.\n\nThe Can Lao Party, controlled by the Ngo family, advocates for nationalism and Catholicism, while Tran Van Huong's Dang Phuc hung (Renaissance Party) puts more emphasis on political reform, anti-communism, and liberalism. The Phai hoang de (Imperial faction) is a parliamentary group made up of monarchists led by Nguyen Phuc Buu Loc. Lastly, there's the Hoc gia, the scholarly faction formed by Prime Minister Hoang Xuan Han.\n\nAmong these, the socialist Dang Xa hoi, which seems to be partially resonating with the Viet Minh's beliefs, has rapidly expaded after taking in former United Front members. In response, the Dang Phuc hung has also attracted many anti-communist MPs."

However, there are great debates on the topic of party politics.\n\nIn particular, the ideological views of Viet Minh and Quoc dan Dang members seem to be completely opposite, insults flying around every time this fact is brought up in parliament.\n\nAccording to Huong's Dang Phuc hung, the Viet Minh are Red Terror-spreading bandits, while the Viet Nam Quoc dan Dang's democratic and nationalist ideals resonate with them and - although they caused the division of the country - many good patriots are among its ranks. Meanwhile, Nguyen's Dang Xa hoi describes the Quoc dan Dang has having sold its soul to China, while to them the Viet Minh are patriots who championed national independence, having a political program that summarizes the farmers' opinions and that contains many points worth considering.\n\nWith unrelenting discussions between the two continuing, the Prime Minister has to support one side, and bring these debates to a much-needed conclusion."

So, I'm asking you to help by leading the party again and inspiring the residents of Tonkin, for a truly united Vietnam.
