 EAF_AMEDEO_DI_SAVOIA_DESC:0 "Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta, also known as the Iron Duke or the Hero of Amba Araghi, was an Italian royalty. Born into the Savoia-Aosta family, a branch of the Italian royal family, he became Duke of Aosta in 1931 and was appointed Governor-General of Italian East Africa after the Second Ethiopian War. During the Second World War, he was called the hero of Amba Araghi for his effective command against the British forces, preventing them from invading East Africa. After the war, he was more critical of the fascist regime and, against the wishes of his country, implemented a tolerant policy toward the local population, which raised the standard of living in East Africa. However, his rule was due to the intrusion of Italian imperialism, and many of the local people did not like him or the Italians, and even if they did not, the local people were still living in poverty compared to the Italian immigrants. There are also insurgents lurking deep in the mountains and in cold villages, which is an urgent problem. Domestic instability and domestic and international repercussions are piling up."
