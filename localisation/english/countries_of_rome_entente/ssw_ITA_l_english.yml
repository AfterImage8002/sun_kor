 SSW_ITA.1.t:0 "A Powerful Italy"
 SSW_ITA.1.d:0 "The Italian Peninsula has, since the times of Ancient Greece, spent much of its time as a fiefdom of the Great Powers. That is certainly not something to be proud of, and it's also the reason we experienced a period of instability after the Resorgimento. So, we will surely need to regain international prestige through strength and unity. With a strong patriotism that even Nazi Germany fears, and citizens possessing a tremendous will, our great dreams shall come true."

 SSW_ITA.3.d:0 "As a result of our diplomatic efforts to date, it has been possible to create a huge \"Roman Empire\" in the Middle East extending from Egypt to Palestine. However it's not enough. We can't achieve our greatest goal without Western Europe. The enemy is still parading in its military boots. Are there any appropriate ways to respond to that?"
 SSW_ITA.3.a:0 "Our allies will become our power"
 SSW_ITA.4.t:0 "Relations with the Balkans"
 SSW_ITA.4.d:0 "The history of the Balkans is the history of Southeastern Italy itself, make no mistake about that. Going forward, Balkan history may even become Italian history. Former Yugoslavia kept rebelling against us and is now a German puppet. There's no doubt that recovering the territories we need for our great goals, including Dacia and Greece, will be along-term policy of ours."

Many mineral resource disoveries were reported in this area where British and French influence has waned. Future expansion in the region will enrich Italy both geographically and economically."

 SSW_ITA.0.t:0 "Heirs of the Empire"
 SSW_ITA.0.d:0 "Since the rise of Fascism, most Italians started to dream of a stronger nation in the form of a reborn Roman Empire. Looking at the ruins of Roman monuments, they believe they should once again rule over world. However, a limited number of intellectuals oppose this notion, aided by several politicians and scholars in telling the public that it was just a fairy tale, as they had no claim and no ethnic ties to Rome. Still, most end up suppressed by public opinion and by the security agencies, those who believe that one day it won't be a dream anymore.\n\nOn his part, Balbo thougth about the distored future of Nazi Germany's National Socialism. And, above all, about the high number of those inside the Fascist Party who thought so as well.\nHe thought that a world crumbling under a renewed Great Depression didn't need a ruler. The economic powehouses of Britain, France, and America had fallen, making sure their rule would never begin again. But, here Mussolini came into play: he changed the conventional way of thinking by creating an ideology called Fascism, and he's now confident that his creation is the world's hegemon already. However, there was something no one wanted to admit, the fear that fascism would eventually decline, as former rulers did and were replaced by new ones. Meaning, Italy would be the next one to fall.\n\nUnwilling to escape these thoughts, Balbo has become more ruthless and wary of betrayal. And so, he started having a dream. A \"Roman Dream\"."
