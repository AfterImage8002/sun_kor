 ssw_chi_jap_war.2.d:0 "Shocking news suddenly came in from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. It seems that in the middle of the Chinese military exercises that started a few weeks ago, Chinese troops one after another took advantage of the gunfire and confusion at the border exercises to invade the Marco Polo Bridge near Fengtai, where the Japanese dispatched troops to China are stationed. \nIn the ensuing standoff between the two armies, our troops demanded that the Chinese troops turn back, but a single bullet fired by one of the two armies led to a military clash that deteriorated into a situation in which 10 Chinese and 6 Japanese troops were killed."

 ssw_chi_jap_war.3.d:0 "In addition, the Chinese army carried out artillery bombardment against the positions of the Japanese and Manchurian armies, and after increasing the number of troops, launched a full-scale attack on our allied forces' positions. Against this, our troops mobilized armored and infantry units from Jidong and started an invasion aiming at occupying the vicinity of Beiping in order to rescue our allied force, and there is a widespread view in the military that the Chinese troops, having detected this information, will launch a preemptive attack."

From there, they issued the Busan Declaration, demanding that Japan withdraw from the entire continent, relinquishing control of all territories outside of its mainland.

Japan had lost most of the areas under its direct control on the continent and Manchukuo, and its people were growing weary of the war due to repeated attacks on the mainland. In response to the recent Pusan Declaration calling for Japan's withdrawal from the continent, Japan decided to make a white peace with the belligerents and withdraw from the war.\nAlthough Japan's faction, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere itself, will survive, Japan's influence will be greatly diminished now that it has lost all of its allies and puppet states that were directly at war with China."

 ssw_chi_jap_war.17.d:0 "A clash between Japan and China at the Marco Polo Bridge, located in northwest Beijing, has developed into full-scale conflict after the declaration of war issued by the [CHI.GetName]. The Chinese government has interpreted the events which unfolded at the bridge as a \"conspiracy against all Chinese people by the Japanese\", stating that Manchuria must be liberated and Japanese troops must be expelled from the continent in order to put an end to such vicious aggressions. On the other hand, the Japanese government has declared that \"The Japanese Army is not to blame for the skirmish at Marco Polo Bridge. The [CHI.GetName]'s actions have disturbed Asian unity, and must be disciplined through unanimous action of the international community by means of a thorough fighting stance.\" Some battles between the two powers have already taken place, and some experts are worried that this war may be the beginning of a third global conflict."

However, a series of clashes at Marco Polo Bridge has seemed to overturn that optimistic view. The [JAP.GetName]'s government has denounced the [CHI.GetName]'s provocative actions as immoral and against the peace-keeping effort; saying that this won't be allowed any longer, they've begun to carry out a full-scale military action. Although the truth of the matter is unknown, there are reports of the [JAP.GetName] having already performed large-scale landing operations on the Chinese coast, with no one doubting that conflict between the two countries will continue to rage on. Also, while most intellectuals in the [JAP.GetName] praise this as a war for justice, many Westerners have severely criticized it as mere Japanese ambition for further expansion into mainland China."
