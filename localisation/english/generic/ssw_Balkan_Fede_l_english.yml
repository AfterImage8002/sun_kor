A new constitution will also be promulgated.\nAs a result of diplomatic and forceful negotiations, including the Balkan War, the [From.GetOldName] expanded its territory, becoming a de-facto multiethnic nation and causing the constitutional problems resolved by the announcement. [From.GetLeader] will continue to serve as head of government, but says he doesn't know how long the current administration will last, as suffrage has been extended to the newly-acquired areas.\nPolitical scientists in various countries have commented about the risk of political instability, citing former multiethnic nations like Austria-Hungary and Yugoslavia as examples. However, the government believes their country can and will survive without falling to civil war, celebrating the complete end of hostilities in the region and the birth of a new state in the Balkans."

The Press Club continues to cover the unknown aspect of the country as an anarchist state in its various papers, but each reporter speculates that the change in the country's name will not change to the [From.GetLeader] system. \nMany political scientists are reluctant to see the continuation of [From.GetName], citing the end of the former multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire and Yugoslavia as examples, and governments continue to struggle to deal with the birth of a new state in the Balkans but incompatible ideologies.\nIn any case, there is no doubt that the Balkan War has ended and a new order has emerged in the Balkans."
