 ssw_indochina_war.1.d:0 "Thanks to domestic stability, unrest within in the Co-prosperity Sphere, and rapid economic growth in our ally China, public opinion calling for Vietnamese reunification has exploded, infusing our people with never-seen-before fervor. Therefore, our President has finally decided to take a big step towards the liberation of South Vietnam.\n\nThe order was swift: from high command to the lowest soldier, preparations for the Unification War immediately began, with tens of thousands ready to be deployed. In the factories, workers relentlessly toiled through increased shifts and production quotas for the sake of more weaponry. The ideal of ethnic unity spread everywhere in the Republic of Yuenan.\n\nIn response to our move, South Vietnam also began war preparations, with Japan trying to avoid direct intervention but still expressing their support, while the Viet Minh resumed their activities for a possible takeover that would worsen the wartime chaos. All forces involved have begun to act for Vietnam's reunification, with the great powers ready to intervene and preserve their own interests."

Our important ally in the region, the Viet nam Dan Quoc, has asked for our support. Namely, weapons, supplies, personnel, and Chinese volunteers to send to Indochina when the time comes.\n\nWhile this would save us the time and effort to put Indochina under our control, there are those in our country worried about Japan, citing a deterioration in our relations and the threat of full-scale war. Either way, we have to choose."

They are preparing to do so immediately, with many weapons and supplies being transported from China to Yuenan by railroad and sea this very moment.\n\nFurthermore, an Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army is being organized, many Chinese soldiers raring to fight under its banner in a show of support for our country. The Yuenannese and Chinese brothers will work together to destroy the strong Japanese imperialism!"

The Vietnamese National Revolutionary Army is escalating its activities, stationing troops at our shared border. This, coupled with reunification propaganda increasing and affecting the entire Viet nam Dan Quoc society, are clear signals of a coming war.\n\nWith imminent war all but a certainty, the Viet Minh are also adding up to the chaos, as rumors of an uprising by them are spreading. This crisis needs to be addressed with all available personnel, weapons and factories."

It seems they will only help us partially so as to avoid all-out war with China, but still promised to dispatch some units in the region.\n\nThe Viet nam Dan Quoc seems to be preparing to attack us, but - to carry out an effective attack on a wide front - there's the possibility they'll also contemplate striking Laos and Cambodia. So, we shall form an extraordinary military alliance with them as part of our defensive strategy. It's vital to create an \"Indochinese Co-prosperity High Command.\""

The attack plan soon came to be known as the \"Tet Offensive\", since it took place during the Vietnamese new year of \"Tet\", showing the Vietnamese resolve to unify their homeland and fight a harsh war.\n\nBeat and destroy Japanese imperialism, shed the people's blood and sweat in order to achieve a united Vietnam!"

 ssw_indochina_war.10.d:0 "With the Tet Offensive underway, and both countries caught in the vortex of war, some who had waited for their moment saw a chance. The League for the Independence of Vietnam. They shunned the imperialist attitudes of both China and Japan, fighting for true Vietnamese independence. Now came their time to shine.\n\nThey transmitted Ho Chi Minh's words through an ant nest-like network and started a mass uprising. In the north, the Truong Chinh-led National Liberation Front of North Vietnam rose up, joining the fight between the Imperial Army and National Revolutionary Army, turning it into a three-way struggle. In the South, Le Duan's National Liberation Front of South Vietnam incited the farmers in the Mekong Delta, using the lush and dense rainforests and fields as a hotbed of dissent.\n\nIn response, nationalists and socialists in Laos and Cambodia have also begun rising up, with Indochina about to be swallowed by the National Liberation Front's red wave."

The recent state of war was the result of renewed fervor towards unification.\n\nMilitary activities are currently limited to the border, while the \"Viet Minh\" (League for the Independence of Vietnam), advocating for total autonomy from China and Japan, have been active in both North and South. Many fear they may start a massive armed uprising.\n\nBoth Japan and China have immediately expressed their support for their allies, in what is quickly becoming a proxy war between the two powers."
