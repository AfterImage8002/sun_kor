 balkan_war.1.d:0 "The Hungarians have failed to accept our ultimatum. It seems they do not understand the consequences. With public outcry, the Romanian soldiers have crossed the border. No one knows what future this upcoming conflict will bring. "

 balkan_war.2.t:0 "Serbian intrusions"
 balkan_war.2.d:0 "Serbia's territorial ambitions for Hungary are on the verge of imploding in the wake of the chaos of the Romanian-Hungarian war. There is a growing opinion within the military to invade Hungarian territory along with the Romanian army. Should we invade now, or remain prepared?"
 balkan_war.2.a:0 "Now is the time to strike!"

 balkan_war.3.t:0 "Croatia's Advancement"
 balkan_war.3.d:0 "The conflict between Croatia and Serbia ended with the intervention of a major power, the Ribbentrop Line, leaving both sides in an incomplete state. With Serbia's incursion into Hungarian territory, Serbian troops on the border have also moved and are fewer in number. There are growing voices in the country that if there is to be a final settlement, it should be now, but what should we do?"

 news_balkan_war.1.t.a:0 "The Second Romanian Hungarian War  "
 news_balkan_war.1.d:0 "Discord in the Balkans prior to World War II was temporarily quelled by the Second Vienna Award and German intervention. While no fundamental solution was attempted, Romania's sharp rivalry with Hungary over Transylvania was somehow balanced, albeit in a very dangerous state, due in part to German influence. Germany's economic collapse, however, has fundamentally shattered that equilibrium. Now, bullets fly with hatred along the border between Romania and Hungary, and endless carnage is taking place."
 news_balkan_war.1.a:0 "Crush those Hungarian bastards!"
 news_balkan_war.1.b:0 "Defeat those Romanian bastards!"
 news_balkan_war.1.c:0 "Let's keep an eye on its progress."
 news_balkan_war.2.t:0 "Chaos in the Balkans"
 news_balkan_war.2.d:0 "Terrorism, provocative words and deeds, airspace violations... The friction of nationalism in the Balkans, which had been building up over and over again, finally crossed something critical. The ultimatum submitted to Hungary by Romania, which held grudges from the previous war, was an affront to national dignity, demanding that Hungary abandon Transylvania. Romanian troops launched a pre-emptive attack on Hungary across Transylvania, and Serbia, which also had territorial grievances, declared war on the country. Croatia also moved to recover territory divided by the Ribbentrop Line.\nThe Balkan conflict is a tangle of conflicting national agendas, and one wonders where the peninsula's future will lead."
 news_balkan_war.2.a:0 "Not a step back!"
 news_balkan_war.2.b:0 "It's always heated in the Balkans."
 balkan_war.16.t:0 "Demand Northern Transylvania"
 balkan_war.16.d:0 "Northern Transylvania was torn from us unjustly in the Second Vienna Award. But our tolerance to the status quo has come to an end. It is time to deliver the Hungarians this ultimatum!"
 balkan_war.16.a:0 "Transylvania is ours."
 balkan_war.17.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
 balkan_war.17.d:0 "Romania has irreverently demanded our rightful land of Transylvania, which we obtained through the Vienna Award. If we push back on this, war will be certain. Our course of action is..."
 balkan_war.17.a:0 "Transylvania is ours!\n§RIf we take this option, war with ROmania will be unavoidable.§!"
 balkan_war.17.b:0 "War must be avoided\n§RThis will shake our government to its core.§!"
 balkan_war.18.t:0 "Return of Northern Transylvania"
 balkan_war.18.d:0 "Diminutive Hungary, fearing our military might, accepted the ultimatum. Now Northern Transylvania is under our control."
 balkan_war.18.a:0 "Trăiască România Mare! (Long live Greater Romania)"
 balkan_war.19.t:0 "Coup "
 balkan_war.19.d:0 "The government's weak stance over Northern Transylvania has severely deteriorated the public's trust in the kingdom. Finally, the cabinet was forced to step down and now a new government is in charge of Hungary."
 balkan_war.19.a:0 "War, or a coup..."
 balkan_war.20.t:0 "Action near the border "
 balkan_war.20.d:0 "This morning, sporadic fighting was reported near the border in Northern Transylvania. The commander on the ground has reported that the Hungarians have shot first, but it is assumed that he was acting on his own initiative, roughly spurred by rumors that the Romanian government will soon declare war on Hungary. Although few Romanians were injured in the incident, tensions on the Romanian-Hungarian border were greatly heightened."
 balkan_war.20.a:0 "It's just a dry run."
 balkan_war.21.t:0 "Action near the border "
 balkan_war.21.d:0 "Sporadic shooting was reported this morning on the Northern Transylvanian border. It is said that our men responded to Romanians. The tension has been rising on the border as the right-wing war hawks have taken control of the Romanian government. The military officials have urged us to strengthen the military as a declaration of war may occur any day. "
 balkan_war.21.a:0 "Are they coming?"
