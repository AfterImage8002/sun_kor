 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Wailing World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The second World War, as experienced by mankind, has transformed the world map the most in all of history. While Japan, Germany and Italy won, establishing their own spheres of influence, the defeated United States and Soviet Union collapsed in a multitude of pieces; Britain and France completely lost all prestige from their former colonial empire. Six years have passed since the end of this tragic World War. The world, enjoying a period of fleeting peace, is about to move forward again. Humanity won't be able to eradicate war, but a future where war eradicates humanity may not be far..."
 SSW_JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, by winning both the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, succeeded in acquiring almost the entirety of East Asia and the Pacific Islands. After this, multi-party politics revived and, as a result, the Army and the Navy became entities distant from the people. Japan aims to further expand its power in the New World via the Pacific Ocean, also by supporting the American Freedom League. Once again, we must fight to keep the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere alive, and create a new world order."
 SSW_ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Italian victory was nothing more than territorial conquest, but the price was great: the expanded army rarely fighting, maintenance costs war debts a dent on the kingdom's finances. The Balbo government thus finds itself in a very precarious situation, facing renewed political turmoil. Even the retired Mussolini has joined the anti-government voices, while various factions are gaining momentum and intensifying activities.\nWhat will the kingdom learn from fascism's madness?"
 SSW_MEX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexicans are facing challenges. Fortunately, their neutrality saved them from following the same path as America. However, their economy is suffering the depression. The spreading rumor about the connection between Cardenas and criminal organizations is ruining the popularity of the government. \nOppositions, like Synachists and Monarchists, are growing day by day.\nThe crisis is just around the corner. Can Mexico overcome?"
 SSW_UTC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The UTC is a country formed by the three largest corporations of the United States. Harry Bennett brought the three companies together during the chaotic American Civil War and was the first to make the ideology of Corporatocracy known in the United States and the world.\nAfter the end of the American Civil War, the UTC became a country that controls major industrial zones such as Chicago and Detroit. Most of their divisions are now mechanized thanks to the cooperation between the three companies in optimizing the automobile manufacture process. \nHowever, it faces threats from the Federated States of America in the east and the American Freedom League in the west. Unless Ford, GM, and Chrysler work together, it will be difficult to survive the chaos of America."
 SSW_CRO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Croatia was founded as a puppet state of Germany in the last war. Although it was forced to surrender its eastern part to Serbia by the then German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, it barely managed to maintain its independence until today. Now that the sovereign nation of Germany is on the verge of collapse, Croatia's fate is becoming uncertain and unpredictable."
 SSW_BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bulgaria was able to acquire the Macedonian region as the result of the victorious last war. However, the country is still unstable due to conflicting ideologies, problems that have been left unresolved, and its location in the Balkans, and there are still sparks of conflict with neighboring countries. We have to solve the piling problems and decide our policy."
 SSW_ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As a member of the Axis powers, Romania fought alongside Germany against the Allies and the Soviets in the last world war and won. However, it lost northern Transylvania to its supposed ally, neighboring Hungary, which still draws its humiliating borders on the globe. In Romania, there is a sense of revenge against Hungary and disappointment in Germany, and it is only a matter of time before this anger turns violent."
 SSW_HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Hungary, as a member of the Axis Powers, fought against the Allied Powers and the Soviet Union and won the war. However, the deterioration of relations with neighboring countries such as Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia after the war strangled Hungary. In Hungary, there are conflicts between the anti-war far-left and the royalists, as well as disappointment with Germany and Italy, and there are fears that this sentiment will be a major blow to the country. "
 SSW_SER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro is the legitimate successor government to the virtually collapsed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia put up a good fight against the Italian invasion in 1940, but due to the lack of preparation of the Italian army, it eventually maintained its sovereignty but lost many territories including Dalmatia. The Croatian nationalist group Ustasha declared Croatia's independence, and Yugoslavia fell into a state of civil war. Taking advantage of this confusion, Bulgaria moved into Macedonia, and Hungary moved into Vojvodina. The Yugoslav government was unable to take any effective measures against this, and the regent Pavle Karadjordjevic resigned. Pertal Bojovic, a hero of the First World War, was appointed as the new regent. He changed the name of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro, which had become a skeleton, and proceeded to rebuild the country. Although a ceasefire with Croatia was brokered by Germany and a ceasefire line was drawn, tensions with Croatia remained high even under the reign of Dušan Šimović, who took over the regency after the death of Peitar Bojović in 1945. On the other hand, in contrast to Italy, Croatia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, Romania, which is also hostile to Hungary and has no territorial disputes with Serbia, has been strengthening its relations with them year after year. In contrast to Italy, Croatia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, Romania, which is also hostile to Hungary and does not have a territorial dispute with Serbia, has been strengthening its relations with Hungary over the years, and is secretly planning a joint invasion of Hungary to regain its territory."
 SSW_TIB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Fortunately this nation, surrounded by mountains and plateaus, escaped the war, houses and temples not seeing the great blaze caused by humanity.  Led by the Dalai Lama, Tibet was supposed to be eden on earth for those embraced by the Buddha.\n\nThe unification of China, Britain's withdrawal, and other world event have brought surprisingly much to the mountains of Tibet. Intellectuals are worried about the return of Chinese oppression, while the people pray and herd goats, but this is going to change someday.\n\nSo that the flame once lit won't be extinguished, we may need to catch this wind of change."
 SSW_IND_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Long looking for a chance to put an end to British colonial rule, World War II was a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for India. Alongside the advancing Japanese army, the \"Leave India\" movement grew which, coupled with a weak British response, resulted in a successful independence. However, not everything was well. Pakistan also declared independence and tried to control the whole subcontinent. India, having just exited a global conflict, was now plunged into the Indo-Pakistani War. It was expected to end soon, but it took India two years... to lose. Of course, none of the problems between the two countries were solved, adding to the domestic issues: serious political instability, an underdeveloped industry, and an inexperienced military. In this collapsing world peace, will India overcome its difficulties and see glory once again?"
 SSW_ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Labour Party won a landslide victory in the general election after the United Kingdom's defeat in the war against Germany. The British people chose better social security over hating the Reich. As a result, the Attlee Cabinet developed a social security policy titled \"from the cradle to the grave\". In terms of diplomacy, the government is promoting a \"closing up shop\" policy, shifting the colonies from direct to economic control and reorganizing the empire into a federation.\nHowever, although the high-welfare high-taxes \"from the cradle to the grave'' was initially well-received by the people, it led to a loss in business competitiveness, causing the nation to suffer from the \"British Disease''. How will the government treat it? And how will the kingdom fight against the German threat? The former hegemon where the sun never set is walking a difficult path..."
 SSW_GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After achieving an early peace with the British in the last war, Germany went to war with the Soviet Union with all its might, successfully pushing the threat from the east away from the Urals and beyond. However, resistance movements in the occupied territories and overinvestment in the Eastern Bloc have forced Germany to overspend, the German economy continues to stagnate, and while Hitler continues to enjoy heroic support, democratic movements have begun to regain momentum. On the other hand, within the regime, the current lack of a successor has led to political instability due to power struggles, and many organizations are on the verge of dysfunction. If these disastrous internal conditions do not improve, the European hegemony will not be able to wipe out the words \"collapse\"."
 SSW_ALF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States, forced into a humiliating peace treaty with Japan in World War II, developed a \"New New Deal\" policy under the Republican Party in order to rebuild the stagnant American economy. At the same time, they promoted the civil rights movement to eliminate the racial discrimination. However, the country was split in two by this effort, and the 1948 election featured a narrow victory of a Republicans-Northern Democrats coalition, causing the Southern political forces - opposed to the Civil Rights Act - to declare the founding of the Federated States of America. This plunged the United States into a second civil war, where the German-backed Federated States won and the Central and Northeastern states declared independence to oppose federal rule. The Freedom League, claiming to be the legitimate successor of the United States, was relegated to the West, looking for an opportunity to reunify America."

 SSW_NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The overwhelming German invasion in the last war ended Norway's brief 35 years of independence and opened the door to its history as part of Germany; in 1950, the wartime vision of a \"National Socialist Norway\" did not come to pass and Norway is still under Germania's grip.\nBut this situation may not last much longer. As the hegemony of the German fatherland is coming to an end, the control of the Riechskommisariats are beginning to show signs of crumbling and bankruptcy.\n\nWill the northern eagle continue to be subservient to the Reich? Or will it once again soar to new heights?"
