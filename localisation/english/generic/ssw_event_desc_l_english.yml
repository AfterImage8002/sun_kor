 COUNTRY_INFO_1:0 "Not all the participants of the war were great powers. Small nations have also joined the war on each side. One nation bravely fought and secured its independence. One nation became a vassal of Axis powers. One nation betrayed its former suzerain to achieve independence... This country also did so and survived until now.\n\nGerman New Order is collapsing. Their power is diminishing day by day. Japanese are barely showing their superiority against China. In the new world, America became a chaotic microcosm of warlords once a stronghold of freedom and democracy.\n\nEven Axis's greatest victory couldn't wipe out wars from the war. New wars are approaching us even now. If you, fortunately, survived it, what happens next?"
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_JAP:0 "\nHaving accepted the policy of the Kanto Army, the Army was steadily advancing its war against the Soviet Union. The military, emphasizing the so-called §R northward theory §!, concluded the §Y Japan-China Non-Aggression Pact §! with China. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the government declared war on the Soviet Union.\nThis gave the Soviet government a sense of crisis, and the U.S. government's spy \"Harry White\" arranged for the U.S. to enter the war against Japan. The U.S. side prepared the §O Hull Note §! and gave an ultimatum to Japan. The government, unable to accept the Hull Note, declared war on the Allies, advancing northward and southward at the same time. In §R Greater East Asia War§! Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and landed on the Malay Peninsula. However, Harry White's rapid maneuvering in the United States made him known as a spy. This exposed the fact that Moscow's agents were spreading in the U.S. government, and the country was divided between anti-war factions who did not want to cooperate with the communists and warring factions who did not want to let Japan has control the Asia. In the midst of all this, a secret agent for the U.S., §tNakanechu§! leads to a massive uprising by the black people who were being overworked in Detroit. The government tried to suppress them, but the anti-war faction joined in the riot and it got out of control."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_SER:0 "\nThe Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro is the legitimate successor government to the virtually collapsed Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia put up a good fight against the Italian invasion in 1940, but due to the lack of preparation of the Italian army, it eventually maintained its sovereignty but lost many territories including Dalmatia. The Croatian nationalist group Ustasha declared Croatia's independence, and Yugoslavia fell into a state of civil war. Taking advantage of this confusion, Bulgaria moved into Macedonia, and Hungary moved into Vojvodina. The Yugoslav government was unable to take any effective measures against this, and the regent Pavle Karadjordjevic resigned. Pertal Bojovic, a hero of the First World War, was appointed as the new regent. He changed the name of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to the Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro, which had become a skeleton, and proceeded to rebuild the country. Although a ceasefire with Croatia was brokered by Germany and a ceasefire line was drawn, tensions with Croatia remained high even under the reign of Dušan Šimović, who took over the regency after the death of Peitar Bojović in 1945. On the other hand, in contrast to Italy, Croatia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, Romania, which is also hostile to Hungary and has no territorial disputes with Serbia, has been strengthening its relations with them year after year. In contrast to Italy, Croatia, and Bulgaria, which is also hostile to Hungary and does not have a territorial dispute with Serbia, have been strengthening their relations with Hungary over the years, and prepared to work closely with Hungary on the military aspect."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_POR:0 "\nWhen Antonio Salazar became the leader of Portugal, there was widespread disorder and poverty roamed the country. As a brilliant economist, he embarked on a large-scale planned economy and built the Estado Novo System under the slogan of \"God, Fatherland, and Family\", referring to the Italian fascist system, and turned Portugal into a stable corporatist state. Salazar was initially attracted by the perfection of fascism as an ideology that could be a counterweight to democracy and socialism, but the long civil war in Spain triggered by the ideological struggle was more than enough to awaken his dreamy mind. As a result, Portugal did not participate in the war but remained neutral as a \"good trading partner\" of the Axis powers. Fortunately for Germany, the Iberian Peninsula was not a target for its bite, and Portugal's independence and territory were preserved.

Fortunately for Germany, the Iberian Peninsula was not a target for its bite, and Portugal's independence and territory were preserved.

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_KOR:1 "\nOfficially part of the Empire of Japan, Korea is now governed by a Governor-General's Office, which is separated from the mainland.\nIt looks like everything is going well, but in actually, there is a lot of corruption going on inside. \nThe Japanese Empire is spending a lot of money on shipbuilding, but the damage is only getting worse. \nOf course, there is no fierce resistance as there was before the war, but that does not mean that everyone is obediently carrying out the orders of our empire. \nThere are so-called \"independence struggles\" deep in the mountains, and even abroad, people are shouting about \"independence struggles\" and ruining our reputation.\nOur goal is to clean up these partisans and let the whole world know that the Korean peninsula is the legitimate territory of Japan through making it a profitable colony or complete Japanization according to the wishes of Japan itself. \n\nIt is now in your hands."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_ITA:0 "§sCountry History §!\n\nBefore the unification, Italy was like a mowing field divided into smaller countries that were influenced and swung around by the great powers such as Austria and France. However, Italy was unified by Vittorio Emanuele II, King of Sardinia and Piedmont, and Giuseppe Garibaldi during the Risorgimento, a movement to unify Italy that was begun around 1815 and has continued to this day. It has been plagued with many problems.\n\n§sBefore the last war §!\n\nOne of the major disasters that befell Italy after unification was the conflict with the Papacy. The Papacy, as a state before unification, had been a tremendous power in Europe since before the Middle Ages. And they had a territory in central Italy. Therefore, conflict with the Papacy was inevitable for the unification of Italy, and with the completion of the unification, it became a serious problem for us. Another problem is the weak national consciousness. Because Italy had been divided for so long, the people perceived themselves as citizens of each independent state, and not as a unified Italian people. These two main problems led to a long period of confusion in Italy.\nThe situation took a sharp turn for the better with Benito Mussolini, the future Duce. One of the ways he succeeded in overcoming this situation was by talking about the people as not Italians, but as the heirs of Rome, the most powerful empire in the old world. And this perception was strengthened by the generous protection of the Roman culture, both the culture that flourished after the Renaissance and the culture that preceded it. This is clearly shown by the fact that later generations of cultural figures around the world praised Mussolini.\n\n§sDuring the second world war §!\n\nItaly signed a treaty with Germany, a country of the same ideology, and when France was defeated by Germany, Italy announced its full participation in the war. However, their main battlefield was Africa and part of the Soviet Union front, so after the war they only ceded claimed territories in Dalmatia (Italian irredentism), expanded their East African colonies, and ceded Mediterranean islands. Other than that, by supporting the independence of Egypt, he succeeded in getting them to join a new camp, the \"Rome Entente\". He has also begun to interfere in the Middle East, where new resources are beginning to be found, and Turkey in particular will join the \"Rome Entente\" as soon as the need arises.\nThe whole of Italy, which is steadily moving toward the realization of the Roman Empire, has received a letter of news. It was the retirement of Benito Mussolini. Mussolini had left the Italian political scene as a hero, citing age and fatigue. Italo Balbo took over as the new president, and set out to solve the current problems and bring prosperity to the Italian nation.\n\n§sNow §!\n\nItaly, as a great power, was able to survive World War II, but only as a result. As a result of its military expansion, the economic situation deteriorated. The North-South problem surfaced. Relations with Germany worsened with Mussolini's retirement. As a result, there is a standoff with guns at the border of the Alps, and in the African colonies, the local people are staring at each other with small arms.\nThe discovery of oil in the Middle East region has caught the attention of the three major powers. But in Germany, Hitler's death is near, and in Japan, the downsizing of the military is accelerating. The advantage lies with Italy. Controlling the Middle East region in the name of recapturing former territories of the Roman Empire will lead to great wealth. However, there is a growing antipathy toward Italy in Egypt. Moreover, in the North African colonies, governance is nearing its limits. We need to be able to control these complex peoples.\nThe Roman Cooperative was formed in order to improve this situation as much as possible. The only way we can truly make Italy prosperous is to unite Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa under this camp, which is based on the old Roman Empire, and to defeat the rising empires of Eastern Europe and the military empires of the North.\nFirst, we will need to decide on a leader and a political entity that will resolve this situation."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_TUR:0 "\nTurkey's non-participation in the last world war has increased the international community's diplomatic distrust of Turkey. The U.S., which had been a great supporter of us, collapsed, and Germany withdrew its support and declared itself hostile to Turkey because of its non-participation in the war. With the spread of nationalism accelerating year by year, the peoples of the east are seeking independence, but this is only creating more confusion by clashing with Kemalist and Islamic forces. The clashes between the various factions are likely to cause further social turmoil in the future.\nTurkey, which has ruled the region for many years as the hegemon of Asia Minor, is now facing a political turning point: to promote democracy by emphasizing harmony among the various ethnic groups, to embrace Islamic forces and revive the glorious Ottoman Empire here, or to carry on the legacy of Kemal.\nBoth Italy and Germany want the straits that Turkey has. Deciding whether to go to war with them or to ally with them is the only choice that will affect Turkey's future."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_UTC:0 "\nThe UTC is a country formed by the three largest corporations of the United States. Harry Bennett brought the three companies together during the chaotic American Civil War and was the first to make the ideology of Corporatocracy known in the United States and the world.\nAfter the end of the American Civil War, the UTC became a country that controls major industrial zones such as Chicago and Detroit. Most of their divisions are now mechanized thanks to the cooperation between the three companies in optimizing the automobile manufacture process. \nHowever, it faces threats from the Federated States of America in the east and the American Freedom League in the west. Unless Ford, GM, and Chrysler work together, it will be difficult to survive the chaos of America."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_SWE:0 "\nAfter much hard work, Sweden succeeded in maintaining its neutrality in the two world wars and maintaining peace and development in the country.\nIronically, Sweden's current status is only barely maintained by the mercy of Goering, who invaded a neighboring country, and the violation of neutrality in concessions to Germany during the war.\nIf Goering changes his mind, there is no guarantee that they will not target our abundant iron ore resources and the Jews we have sheltered.\nSweden's vaunted domestic weaponry has already become obsolete to other countries and needs to be improved as soon as possible. Alternatively, we need the power to bury our opponents with a single blow."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_FSA:0 "\nThe Federated States of America came into being as the culmination of the fascist movement in North America. William Dudley Pelley, a mystic, mobilized the White Silver Legion as soon as the American Civil War began, and rapidly expanded its size while gathering support from conservative forces and the Axis powers, finally taking over the capital, Washington D.C.\nThey are now feared to be the most dangerous group in North America. However, their ideology of anti-communism, white supremacy and blind obedience to Christianity is another aspect of American freedom and democracy that has been hidden behind the scenes.\nA tentative truce has lulled the situation in North America, while preparations are secretly being made for a war of unification. When he awakens from his meditation in the White House, America will be faced with its greatest challenge."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_ENG:0 "\nAfter Britain's humiliating defeat in the war, the bold social welfare policies of the New Labour government have failed.\nThe economic situation has continued to worsen, and the country is now called the sick man of Europe.\nBut the once-great empire has not given up the fight against totalitarianism. Retaliation against Germany is Britain's mission, and all proud British people will support it."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_LIB:0 "\n Liberia had been unstable since its creation, its various problems including native discrimination by Americo-Liberians. As US influence diminished during the civil war, the country found itself on its own as an independent nation. However, there came a sudden influx of blacks escaping from the civil war, Liberia becoming tumultuous for a while. Most of them were part of the well-off middle class in America, so the Liberian administration used their money to help them settle. Then, William Tubman came to power in a situation where the people were divided in four factions: the black exiles, the Americo-Liberian, the natives, and the Muslims. Tubman first worked with the Americo-Liberians in a colonial oligarchic system. His aim was to alleviate their dissatisfaction and stabilize parliament. Of course, the other forces didn't keep silent, and set up their own political organization, in which Tubman also actively participated. When Americo-Liberians realized their power was gone it was too late, as they couldn't compete with the exiles, the natives, and the small number of Muslims who joined. So, they all built a political system in which they could work together. When it looked like all domestic problems had been solved, the factions realized that their cause was the lack of a common historical and cultural identity. Tubman now has to carry out new political reforms. In this world, newly-independent vulnerable nations are faced with serious decisions."

Raúl Salinas Lozano, a member of the revolutionary party who planned to get rid of Cardenas, made a move, but it failed due to lack of support from the people.\nOn the other hand, the far-right and labor union factions have been steadily gaining support, increasing their chances of seizing power.\nMexico's future awaits the removal of divisions in public opinion and conflicts between political parties..."

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_GER:0 "\nHitler was a great and flamboyant ambitious man whose rich talent was undoubtedly gifted to him by the heavens.\nHe was a constant flame of light for the German people, and he hoped to remain so. In fact, thanks to his leadership on the Western Front, Germany was able to reach an early peace and fight against the Soviet Union with all its strength. Finally, in 1944, they succeeded in forcing the communists to admit defeat, and they became the world's dominant power. However, the flame would eventually die out. But the flame would eventually die out, even if it was a gift from the heavens. The Führer, who had been our guiding light, had his talents eroded by drugs after the war, and his leadership was no longer what it had been. His powerful aides are not worried about him, but only dream of becoming the heir to the Reich.\nWhat will the future hold for Greater Germany? When the flame burns out, the sky will be dark. However, anyone cannot live in the dark."
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_Lebensraum:0 "\nThe unrest in the home country was, of course, felt here in the district of the Reichskommissariat. Hitler's leadership declines and his subjects are struggling for power. This was reason enough to cast a pall over the bright future of Greater Germany brought about by the war. We all die, and so will the Führer. I was aware of that. But who would have thought that his talent would be the only thing that would die while he was still alive?\nHowever, there was no time for such sentimentality. Just then, I heard a young man shouting from the street.\n\"It's over for Germany. It's over. It is completely exhausted and will be eaten by Russia at any moment. And when that happens, if it happens, we'll be the first ones to be occupied!\"\nOr maybe it is. ...... Don't, he's a purge target. I have to stop the speeches soon. No, but ......\nGermany's wavering is more serious than I thought."

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_CHI:0 "\n§Y- China§!\nThe land of China has a rich history, and for a long time it was the cultural center of the world. However, the intervention of various powers at the end of the Qing Dynasty weakened China, and the Xinhai Revolution, which began in 1911, led to the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty by Sun Yat-sen and others. Chiang Kai-shek, who took control of the Nationalist Party after Sun Yat-sen's death, completed the Northern Expedition and completed the unification of the country in 1928, although the influence of the warlords remained strong. However, the following 1930s were a series of hardships. In addition, Japanese invaded the northeastern part of the country and carried Puyi, the former emperor of the Great Qing Dynasty, to declare the establishment of Manchukuo.\n§Y- The Crossroads of Japan-China Relations§!\nHiroki Hirota, the prime minister at the time, appointed Aoi Shigemitsu as vice-minister of foreign affairs, while also serving as foreign minister himself. He promoted harmonious diplomacy, which sought to improve relations with China and secure peace through \"cooperation and assistance among the three countries of Japan, Manchukuo, and China.\nThe Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek, who had advocated a policy of \"An nei rang wai\" which means wiping out domestic enemies at first and later prevent foreign invasion, welcomed this move, and the Treaty of Non-Aggression between Japan and China was signed on April 12. Although this treaty established non-aggression between Japan and China, the Chinese side did not approve of the Manchurian Benevolent Treaty or the Manchurian Agreement, and the Kwantung Army reacted sharply, but this reaction was quelled by Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, who is commander of the Kwantung Military Police.\n§Y- Xi'an Incident§!\nIn April, Chiang Kai-shek signed a treaty of non-aggression between Japan and China, but Zhang Xueliang, whose homeland had been taken by the Kwantung Army, was adamantly opposed to the treaty. In December, Chiang led his troops to arrest Zhang in Xi'an. This was the Xi'an Incident. In December, Chiang led his troops to arrest Zhang in Xi'an.\n§Y- Chinese Civil war went a quagmire§!\nAfter the conclusion of the Treaty of Non-Aggression between China and Japan and the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek resumed the civil war between China and Japan. Mao Zedong, who had been trying to fend off the crisis with the unified goal of anti-Japanese, found himself in a difficult position, so he tried to endure and wait for the right moment by receiving support from the Soviet Union, another socialist power. In the end, the National Revolutionary Army failed to achieve its goal of capturing Yan'an by the end of 1962.\nThe Nationalist Revolutionary Army, which boasted overwhelming material and human resources, wore out the Red Army day by day, and even Soviet support could not cover its losses. Finally, in 1939, Yan'an fell, and Mao Zedong and his bandits fled to Xinjiang, relying on Sheng Shih Cai, and the Chinese Civil War ceased for the time being.\n§Y- Afterimage of Nanjing decade§!\nIn the ten years following the ceasefire, China's economy grew by leaps and bounds. While the world was engulfed in war, China maintained peace, took a stance closer to the Allies, and earned large profits by exporting military equipment and daily necessities. However, when World War II ended, the military industry came to a standstill and oversupply continued. With the rapid development of industrialization, cases of poor working conditions and pollution became commonplace and became a social problem.\n§Y- Chiang Kai-shek's downfall§!\nChiang Kai-shek, worried about the decline in his support due to the failure of his economic policies, set out to eliminate the Communist Party and the warlords that still held sway in Xinjiang in order to consolidate his position and support. Although the offensive against the remnants of the Communist Party in Xinjiang was successful and they were able to control all of Xinjiang, other warlords sensed the danger before it happened and, in cooperation with anti-Chiang forces other than the Communists, abducted Chiang Kai-shek and forced him to resign. After that, Gu Zedong took over as acting presidency, although he was led by the warlords, in consideration of the Nationalist forces. The military faction wanted to establish a federal republic with a local government, but the KMT members considered it a betrayal of the Three Principles of the People and Sun Yat-sen. Whatever the case, this political vacuum must be ended.\n§Y - The future of China§!\nThere are many problems that still exist in China. There are economic struggles for supremacy, political turmoil. And there is a breaking point in the tension with Japan, which is growing by the day. China is certainly approaching a crossroads. Will we be able to withstand this ordeal?\n"

As a result, the Great Bulgarianists gained a lot of influence and eventually came to power. However, due to its location, the country has always been home to a wide range of ideologies, and this led to political turmoil. In addition, the communist influx that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, as well as the country's monarchists and democrats, added to the turmoil, and the unresolved problems deepened the confusion.

But we are often deceived by hope and greeted by despair. In Eastern Europe, where the influence of Germany and Italy keeps the whole order, the territorial and ethnic hatred against us from Hungary is deep-rooted, and the resentment grows louder with each passing day. If the fetters of either Germany and Italy were to be removed, war with Hungary would be inevitable. The hope that I had finally obtained and the hope that I could see anew. In order to protect them somehow, we must make all possible preparations. Bulgaria has a grudge against us, though not as strong as Hungary's. Let's start by clearing the grudge here.

However, the decline of the Führer, who should lead Germany in its hegemony over Europe, has been conspicuous. If Germany is no longer interested in the Balkans, will Romania abide by the Vienna Ruling, or will it once again try to cross the Carpathians and take North Transylvania, as it did at the end of 1918? Romania is not the only problem facing the Balkans. With the independence of Croatia, Yugoslavia was reduced to two countries. At the same time, some countries, including our own, have moved into parts of the country to protect own people. When the Serbs plan to revive Yugoslavia, it is inevitable that our country will be involved. However, there are also many countries that will be involved at that time. Our country's problems are not limited to diplomacy. We have to deal with an uninhabited throne, a turbulent ideology, and economic development.

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_IRE:0 "In the years since the World War, Ireland has changed dramatically.\nA significant increase in the number of seats in parliament to improve the one-vote margin succeeded in gaining the support of many citizens. The anti-British and pro-German line of diplomacy succeeded in receiving significant support from Germany, which allowed the domestic industry to grow significantly.\nOn the other hand, the radical right is gradually gaining power in the country, and Irish democracy is facing a crisis of survival. Even the Nationalist Party, a conservative democratic party, took a step to the right, sending shockwaves through the Irish parliament.\nIn these turbulent times, we are left with the choice of continuing to defend democracy, moving to the right and becoming subservient to Germany, or going red by further supporting the workers and the common people.\nNo one knows which is right..."

The lone lion of the snowy mountains will soon shed its pure white fur and look no different from any other wild animal. That's samsara.\n\nStarting with the British interference, Tibet has undergone a major transformation. The introduction of modern technology, such as wireless communication, the organization of a modern army to replace the monks, such as the Dobudob, and the spread of new ideas by the Chinese Communist Party and the German expedition more than ten years ago. In the midst of all this, the aristocracy and monks continue to struggle, and Tibetan politics is maintained in a curious balance. But this will not last much longer.\n\nChina's pressure is increasing day by day, British support is no longer there, and Tibet will not be able to maintain its independence unless it takes actions that it has not had since ancient times: independence and modernization. Religious reform is also inevitable. On the other hand, if we fail to achieve this, we will be doomed to be buried in the past, like Hotan in the north...\n\nThe Himalayas look down on us and watch over us. This plateau embraces us passionately and sometimes gives up on us. The high priests of the past will be born again in the present and will guide us when we are lost.\n\nThat is life, that is samsara. That is the foundation of Tibet."

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_BHU:0 "\nNestled in the foothills of the great Himalayan mountains, Bhutan is also in the midst of a critical turning point.\n\nAfter the Druar War, British aid and exchange continued despite the country's isolation, but now no one comes to Bhutan except for a hollow annual grant of 100,000 rupees based on the Sinchula Treaty and India's constraints on diplomatic rights. The Punakha Treaty has been abrogated and India is no longer sure whether it will protect us or not.\n\nAlthough Bhutan is gaining independence, the old leadership of Penrope, Jekhenpo, and Druk Desi in various parts of the country are once again challenging the Druk Gyalpo (Thunder Dragon King), and the central government and the royal court, which were heavily dependent on the British, are unprepared, including the military. In addition, there is the barrier of reform in various aspects that must be overcome in the modern era. However, it is the people themselves who are making the barriers thicker and higher."

 COUNTRY_INFO_1_EAF:0 "\nIn 1936, as the world became more chaotic by the day, a cunning, fierce and greedy eagle spotted a lion standing quietly. With a desire for revenge, the eagle devoured the lion, and on its corpse, the new East African Empire was founded.\n\nIn 1940, as soon as the home government saw the superiority of the German army, it jumped on the bandwagon and joined the war against Britain and France. Of course, East Africa inevitably joined the war as well, and with very little in the way of supplies, it won many victories in Somaliland and in the early stages of the war. But that was only for the first few months.\n\nBy the end of 1940 and the beginning of 1941, they were at a disadvantage in terms of troops, supplies, and almost everything else. The British started out like virgins, but by that time they were acting like rabbits and gradually cornered East Africa. However, due to various fortunate events, starting with the great victory in Egypt, the British succeeded in defeating the enemy's large army in the decisive battle of Gondar, and the Second World War in East Africa ended in a great victory with the successful expansion of territory.\n\nHowever, there were still many problems. The rebellion of the local people represented by the Ethiopian guerrillas, the Albegnochi, relations with the home country, and the refugees from German territory. It is up to us to find a way out of this."
