 SSW_ROM.63.t:0 "The Reopening of Baneasa Race Track"
 SSW_ROM.63.d:0 "Horse racing in Romania has always been popular amongst the royalty and the public as a \"kingly sport\" ever since its inception. However, the last World War has put it in a difficult spot, with the requisition of racehorses, soaring feed prices due to food shortages, etc. Although the training and breeding of new horses continued, their quality inevitably declined. Even after the war, it was difficult to hold competitions due to domestic instability, and no matches have been held since. In light of the recent situation, where political stability has been restored and the economy is gradually recovering, the Romanian Jockey Club has insisted on resuming competitions, asking the state to finance the rebuilding of stables and to return jockeys drafted into the military. Reviving the Romanian horse-racing industry could result not only in better racehorses, but also in better war-horses. However, for that purpose, large amount of funds are needed, with some senior politicians saying that if this is an excuse to strengthen the army, we should refuse outright. Should we accept the Jockey Club's request?"

 SSW_ROM.64.d:0 "Today, the 67th Romania Derby was held at Baneasa Race Track for the first time since 1945. Nearly 50,000 spectators had gathered to watch the battle to determine which of the three-year-old horses competing was the fastest. Epigon, with Romania's top jockey Aristide Cucu on the saddle, received a lot of attention, winning the derby as if to respond to this popularity. It was a long-sought victory for Cucu, and a memorable day in the history of Romanian horse racing."

 SSW_ROM.65.t:0 "New War Horses"
 SSW_ROM.65.d:0 "Amazing news have just come in from our war-horse ranch. Starting from race-horses, our past knowledge on the subject has been brought back, and the animals' pedigree has been reviewed. As a result, the new horses' abilities have improved significantly compared to the previous year's. The unnecessary fixation on horse racing by the upper classes has been completely dispelled and, consequently, some military personnel said that the new war horses have strengthened the army."

 ssw_horse_race.1.d:0 "The Sapporo Stakes, held at Sapporo Race Track on September 3, have become a hot topic on the horse-racing world: second-most favorite Tokino Minoru has defeated the favorite Track O, winning with a large margin in record time.\nIts pedigree is a 3x4 cross of The Tetrarch, known in Irish horse racing for its speed. No one doubts that Tokino Minoru has the 18.75% blood volume generated by inbreeding, a \"miracle combination\" for producing winner horses, inheriting The Tetrarch's speed and using it to win a race held in July with the amazing record of 3 Furlongs. In addition, its father Theft is the famous stallion which won first place in the Leading Sire, and its descendants have given overwhelming results - especially in female Classics. However, its speed hasn't been tested in the Tokyo Yushun yet, as Theft died last April, in the middle of his career.\nThe dream to conquer that derby, that the father couldn't fulfill, may be achieved by its \"son\" Tokino Minoru."

 ssw_horse_race_news.2.d:0 "\"Top, Tokino Minoru! Itsusei putting in the whip! Mitsuhata, Hirohomare with a last sprint!\"\nNearly 70,000 spectators gathered at the Tokyo Racecourse on Derby Day to see Tokino Minoru, the second undefeated Double Crown in history. Previously, Tokino Minoru won Shiba's Satsuki Sho with a Japanese record of 2000m, and was expected to be the favorite in the Tokyo Yushun. There was some anxiety about its legs and training, but during the race - as if to prove everyone wrong - it jumped to the front, shook off the following pursuit, and won with a record time of 2 minutes and 31.1 seconds. The spectators were greatly excited by this undefeated Double Crown, first since the famous Kurifuji, resulting in an accident where some enthusiasts flooded into the track after the race damaging the fence, but the Tokyo Yushun still drew to a close without any major problems. Many are certainly anticipating this autumn's Kikuka Sho, as Tokino Minoru is expected to become the first Classic Triple Crown since St Lite. The owner, Nagata, has also announced that Minoru will be the first overseas horse in history to become a Triple Crown."

The news was reported extensively by every paper, with writer Nobuko Yoshiya contributing to the following memorial on Mainichi Shinbun: \"It ran ten races, won ten victories, and died suddenly before winning the derby it was aiming for, but it was a legendary horse, born to win the derby\". After the funeral, the body was taken to the Tokyo Racecourse Cemetery and buried next to Governor, 4th Japan Derby winner. Nagata is mourning his death, but plans to make a movie titled \"The Legendary Horse.\""

 ssw_horse_race_news.4.d:0 "In April, the Grande Premio Sao Paulo was held in Brasil. Yatasto, undefeated in all of the four crowns in Argentina, was also scheduled to run. Fans had high expectations regarding what this horse would achieve next, so the event was widely advertised. However, as anxiety started to weaken its legs, it was about to be pulled out from the Grande Premio. The Jockey Club, fearing that - if Yatasto were to retire from the biggest event of the year - the disappointment of the fans would be immeasurable, which in turn would have a huge impact on ticket sales, insisted for the horse to attend. Many also felt that the race would have no meaning otherwise and, after the media also complained in sensationalist and enthusiastic tones, the horse was reluctantly allowed to race. However, with its legs in a bad condition and the jockey unable to guide him in a straight line, Yatasto couldn't showcase its abilities, suffering its first defeat by finishing in 4th place."

 ssw_horse_race_news.5.d:0 "At the Grande Premio Sao Paulo, Yatasto was defeat due to leg problems, but he soon re-entered the fray at the G2 Clasico Chacabuco after a three-month rest. Without any anxiety by the time it returned, Yatasto won against 15 others, going on to the General Puredon, a long-distance race with 4000m of turf. However, the event was no match for it, literally: as soon as it started, Yatasto cut off Hana and the others and left them behind. At the finish line, the difference between Yatasto and the other contestants couldn't be calculated with the traditonal measurement of a \"horse's length.\" The overwhelming victory led to reports estimating the difference as a \"length of a road.\" Yatasto is still a young 4-year-old horse, but its expected value has already increased in anticipation for it to reach adulthood."

 ssw_horse_race_news.6.d:0 "A female horse set a historic achievement: mare Joiosa won the Southern Cross Gran Prix held in November. The pedigree of Joiosa, whose dark mane shines, includes famous horses like Swynford, Blandford, Blenheim, and Mahmoud. It also inherited legendary pedigrees: Lady Josephine and Mumtaz Mahal from the maternal side, and the Triple Crowns Gainsborough and Rico from the paternal side. This superlative mare's rarity, considered by some as the fusion of famous South American and European horses, is increased by its 1st place in both the Brazilian and Rio derbies. After this, Joiosa's battle for the Triple Crown started. If this were to be won as well, it would set the unprecedented achievement of both a Derby Double and a Triple Crown."

 ssw_horse_race_news.7.d:0 "The long-awaited confrontation between brothers Rio Pallanga, undefeated Triple Crown, and senior champion Sherbet finally took place during the Clasico Jockey Club del Peru. This race, gathering influential senior horses from all over the world, was the first senior match for Rio Pallanga and, although this event is quite difficult for the \"Classic\" rank, there are high expectations for this one, who won its previous runs by a large margin of 10 plus Lengths. Meanwhile, its half-brother and race-favorite Sherbet is a 1953 Derby horse and a Senior-class champion. As most expected, the competition was more of a two-way race between the brothers: a fierce dead heat developed, with a difference of 10 plus Lengths from the others. They fought until the very end, but Rio Pallanga fell slightly behind at the finish line, resulting in a victory for Sherbet. The younger brother suffered its first defeat at the hands of its sibling, but his price didn't decrease, as the expectations for Peru's first Quadruple Crown only increased in number."
