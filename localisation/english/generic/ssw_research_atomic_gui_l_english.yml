 SSW_atomic.1.title:0 "Testing our new weapon"
 SSW_atomic.1.desc:0 "The new weapon we've been developing for many years is finally just one step away from practical use. Our scientists want to carry out a test with the new weapon."
 SSW_atomic.1.a:0 "Excellent."
 SSW_atomic.2.title:0 "Successful test"
 SSW_atomic.2.desc:0 "On this day, we've won a great scientific and technological victory: we were able to confirm the effectiveness of our new bomb by conducting a detonation test. This weapon holds a destructive power that sets it apart from any other, and even a single drop of this monstrosity can change the tides of war. When our people heard the announcement, they were excited and taken aback by the scientific power of their homeland. If this bomb is ever used into an actual battle, it shall demonstrate its full power."
 SSW_atomic.2.a:0 "This weapon will change war itself."
 SSW_atomic.3.title:0 "Successful test"
 SSW_atomic.3.desc:0 "Our scientific knowledge has finally led to the creation of the ultimate weapon. On this day, we carried out a detonation test with a new type of bomb, which uses a new material, and confirmed its effectiveness. In addition, the radiations it emits will kill even creatures not hit directly by the blast. High-ranking military officials have announced that this weapon could not only change the course of war, but also the concept of war itself. Some are wary of this, while others look forward to deploying it in actual combat."
 SSW_atomic.3.a:0 "Order its immediate mass-production."
 SSW_atomic.4.title:0 "Successful test"
 SSW_atomic.4.desc:0 "Today, the detonation test of a new bomb was conducted: the results were good, with senior military officials already asking government leaders to authorize mass-production. However, according to the engineers involved in the development, the \"radiation\" it emits are extremely dangerous for all living things and, once used, the place where it was dropped will turn into a literal wasteland. The majority of our population is very excited to hear about its successful development, but we'll need to treat this new weapon with caution..."
 SSW_atomic.4.a:0 "Scientific progress may not coincide with actual progress at all."
 SSW_atomic.5.title:0 "Successful test"
 SSW_atomic.5.desc:0 "Our scientific power may have finally exceed God's: we succeeded in detonating a new bomb which, according to military officials, has a destructive power unmatchable by conventional weapons, and may even change the course of war. However, our engineers have suggested that this bomb could be extremely dangerous to the user and the target both. If mishandled, we could destroy not only the enemy, but also ourselves..."

 SSW_atomic_news.1.title:0 "[From.GetName] has an atomic bomb!"
 SSW_atomic_news.1.desc:0 "According to a [From.GetName] announcement, they seem to have succeeded in acquiring an atomic bomb. If we take their government's words for granted, the [From.GetName] is ready for mass-production of this weapon already, and they will be deployed in a few months. Supporting their claims, there's information that an earthquake with unique waveforms was registered by countries bordering the [From.GetName], while there isn't any evidence to suggest the contrary. In any case, there's no doubt that this will contribute to further improving the [From.GetName]'s international standing."
 SSW_atomic_news.1.a:0 "Interesting"

 SSW_atomic_news.2.desc:0 "According to an announcement by the University of Roma La Sapienza, the nuclear physics research team led by Enrico Fermi has completed the world's first reactor, succeeding in the Critical Test today.\n\n\nThe Nuclear Fission phenomenon researched by the experiment was at first discovered by German physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1939, while it was theoretically summarized by a total of four people, including Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch. It was thought that large amounts of energy could be obtained from it, but many scientists found it difficult to achieve the fission.\n"

 SSW_atomic_news.3.d:0 "In the midst of the escalating tide of war, a new type of bomb, an Atomic Bomb possessing more power than any other weapon ever developed, exploded for the first time in the long history of mankind in the skie above [From.From.GetName]. Its power was literally devastating, instantly destroying all facilities in the vicinity: cities, factories, forts, and everything else, annihilating all human life there at the same time. [From.From.GetName] was destroyed by this attack and, while the [From.From.Owner.GetName] is hastily dispatching aid, it will be some time before the full details come to light. In any event, the [From.From.Owner.GetName] must consider to either surrender and avoid further terror, or be determined in its fight against the enemy while fearing another such attack. Above all, what is certain is that this event isn't the end, but the beginning of a new era."
