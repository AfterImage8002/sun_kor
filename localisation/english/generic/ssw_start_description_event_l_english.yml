 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_GENERIC:0 "It wasn't just great powers who joined the war.\nNations big and small defending their independence against the likes of Britain, Germany and Japan, nations trying to survive by surrendering their sovereignty, nations betting on their overlord's victory... this country was one of the lucky few that survived in this chaos until now.\nEurope's pitiful state, hidden under a gorgeous exterior, is being revealed by Germany's new order, in the chessboard of Asia Japan barely keeps its advantage against China in a Great Game of sorts, while America went from a bastion of freedom and democracy into a chaotic land of speculation and desire.\nWe were fortunate enough not to get involved in the war and survive intact, but what is left for us to do?"
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_JAP:0 "Signing the Sino-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact was an easy-to-understand preparation for the upcoming war between us and the Soviet Union.\n\"§qHokushinron§!\" (Northwards Expansion) was a steady step towards the cause we were aiming for, that road paved with courage and confidence in our power. In June, when the hydrangeas bloomed and painted the mainland, Germany invaded the USSR. We declared war soon after. Everything went according to plan. If there was one flaw, it would be the Soviets being aware of our move. How?\n\nIt goes without saying that the crisis the enemy government found itself in was of the highest degree. The problem was their response. They had no choice but to ask their spy in the US administration, \"Harry White\", for help. And so, the United States presented us with the \"Hull Note\", an ultimatum. Of course, we couldn't accept their demand, issuing a declaration of war against the Allies. We had to move north and south at the same time. Still, our power soared the skies. No matter the task. In the Greater East Asia War, a sidetracked Japan steadily won.\nThe divine wind was blowing in our favor.\n\nIn the United States, Harry White's handiwork exposed him as a spy. As a result, many of Moscow's agents within the government were discovered. The country then divided into two factions: an anti-war group, disliking cooperationg with the Reds, and and pro-war one, not wanting Japan to take control of Asia. The former won out, and peace was signed.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union came quickly after that. However, that was the result of our power, so it wasn't at all surprising. We had to win and they had to lose. That's all there was to it.\n\nThe problems came after the war. The world went towards disarmament, and our army weakened. Then the recession. However, above all, was the surprising intensification of Sino-German collaboration. We thought that winning the war would've given us hegemony over Asia.\nStill, China. What a world! Our supremacy began and then clashed with theirs. That is frightening enough. But as usual, it's no problem. If our experience is anything to go by.\n\nAnd that's all we have to keep in mind.\nCourage is a small step from recklessness, and excessive confidence is just self-deception. The road to hell is the same, paved with good intentions, bravery and confidence."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_SER:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia and Montenegro is the legitimate successor of Yugoslavia. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia managed to keep its sovereignty after the Italian invasion in 1940, but lost many of its territories after Bulgaria and Hungary also moved in. When the Croatian nationalists Ustase declared independence, regent Petar Bojovich changed the country name from the Yugoslavia to Serbia and Montenegro. A ceasefire agreement with Croatia was reached through German mediation, but tension still exists between the two countries, even under Bojovich's successor Dusan Simovich. Hostile to Hungary, Croatia, and Italy due to territorial disputes, the Kingdom has always had friendly relations with Romania, and is ready to work closely with them military-wise."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_POR:0 "When Antonio Salazar became leader of Portugal, chaos and poverty were widespread. An excellent economist, he embarked on a large-scale economic plan to build an \"Estado Novo\" (New State) under the slogan of \"God, Country, Family\", inspired by Italian Fascism, turning Portugal into a stable corporatist nation. Initially interested in fascism as something that could act as a counterweight to democracy and socialism, the Spanish Civil War, caused also by ideological struggles, was more than enough to make Salazar change his mind. As a result, Portugal remained neutral during the war - albeit being a \"good trading partner\" of the Axis. Fortunately, Germany wasn't interested in the Iberian Peninsula, so Portuguese independence and territories were preserved. Seven years after the end of the war, \"status quo\" is Salazar's main focus: his country is content with staying on the sidelines, without expanding nor collapsing..."

 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_ITA:0 "§sBirth of a Nation§!\nBefore the Unità (unification), Italy was divided into smaller countries swayed by the great powers, like Austria and France. However, during the \"Risorgimento\" unification movement beginning in 1815, Italy was unified by Victor Emmanuel II, King of Sardinia-Piedmont, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, known as the Hero of the Two Worlds (as he also fought in South America).\n\n§sBefore World War II§!\nOne of the major problems of unified Italy was the conflict with the Holy See. The Papal States, a pre-unification country, held tremendous influence in Europe since before the Middle Ages, as well as territories in central Italy. Another problem was the weak sense of nationalism: as Italy had been divided for a long time, the people regarded themselves as citizens of the pre-unification states before identifying as Italians. These two main issues left Italy unstable for a long time.\nThen, the situation suddenly changed for the better when Benito Mussolini became the Duce (dictator). He regarded his people not as Italians, but as successors of Rome, one of the oldest empires in the world. His belief was strengthened through the protection of Renaissance and Roman culture. That much is clear from the praise that Mussolini received at the time from cultural figures all over the world.\n\n§sDuring World War II§!\nItaly signed an alliance with Germany, a country with a similar ideology, announcing its participation in the war after France surrendered. However, they were mainly active in Africa, playing only a small part on the Eastern front. After the war, they gained Dalmatia (an irredentist claim) and the Mediterranean Islands; their East African colony also expanded. Also, by supporting Egyptian independence, they succeeded in making a new faction, the Rome Entente.\nItaly was is steadily moving towards the rebirth of the Roman Empire, when news spread all over the country: Benito Mussolini was retiring due to age and fatigue. He left Italian politics as a hero. Italo Balbo was chosen to succeed him, taking steps to solve Italy's current problems and make it prosper.\n\n§sPresent§!\nItaly was able to exit World War II as a great power, but that was the only good news: the economy deteriorated due to the arms race, a North-South divide apppeared, and relations with Germany deteriorated with Mussolini's retirement. As a result, the two nations now glare at each other at their borders on the Alps, and from their African colonies.\nThe discovery of oil in the Middle East attracted the attention of the three major powers. However, with Hitler near-dead and Japan disarming, Italy has an advantage. Dominating the Middle East in the name of restoring the Roman Empire will lead to great wealth. Still, there are growing anti-Italian sentiments in Egypt, while our administration struggles to govern the North African colonies.\nThe Rome Entente was formed to improve the situation as much as possible. Based on the former Roman Empire, unifying Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as destroying the other powers will be the one true way to make Italy prosper.\nFirst of all, it will be necessary to decide which leader and political system will solve this situation."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_TUR:0 "The Republic of Turkey, declared on October 29, 1923 by Turkish hero Mustafa Kemal, rejected all foreign interference after its defeat of World War I and fell into a precarious state after his death. In 1938, his successor Ismet Inonu remained neutral during the World War II, but sought to establish relations with both the Axis and the Allies, and to build up the Turkish military. The outbreak of the German-Soviet War increased the possibility that neighboring Turkey would be involved, with Pan-turkish philosophers like Nihal Atsiz and military officers like Husnu Erkilet appealed to join on the Axis side to liberate of Turkic ethnicities living in Russian territory.\n\nDue to the introduction of a wealth tax and the destabilization of trade, Inonu's regime began to waver. On May 28, 1943, German-backed nationalists and soldiers staged a coup, resulting in a new government. The neutral Field Marshal Fevzi Cakmak was elected President and, a month later, Turkey joined the Axis and declared war on the Allies on July 30, 1943.\n\nHowever, the Turkish army had hardly modernized since its war against the Greeks and, in the battle with the Red Army, Turkish territory ended up being occupied. However, after Fall Blau started, Soviet supplies started running thin, while Axis reinforcements arrived in the Caucasian and Anatolian fronts. By the end of the war in 1944, Turkish forces had reached Azerbaijan.\n\nThe expansion of the country and the liberation of the Turkic ethnicities from the Soviet Union led to a rise in domestic nationalism, emboldening the people. However, after that, various problems started to occurr. First of all, the incorporation of many new ethnic groups caused Armenian resistance to intensify, while the Mountain Turks also stepped up their opposition to the government. Another problem was the economic crisis from the enormous war costs. The problem was averted by emergency aid from Germany and Italy, but the following Treaty of Izmir signed under Reich pressure resulted in their becoming even more economically and militarily influential within Turkey.\n\n\"Turkish-Arab War\"\nTo distract the public from these problems, Cakmak provoked the Turkish-Arab war on December 15, 1944, with the aim of liberating Tukic people in the region. Taking advantage of what it learned against the Soviet Union and the support from the Wehrmacht, the Turkish army kept the advantage from beginning to end. Germany, friendly with both Iraq and Turkey, intervened and enforced almost all of the latter's demands, ending the war with the Treaty of Munich on February 23, 1945.\n\nCakmak also dedicated himself to domestic affairs and, by denying past secularist policies, emphasized Islam in order to appease people from rural areas. The policy succeeded in gaining overwhelming support in the countryside, but got thr backlash of the urban elite and the Kemalist-dominated military, as well as cabinet minister Nihal Atsiz. The country is steadily recovering from the unrest of the war, but the government is also breaking up, while overwhelming German influence threatens to bring harm Turkey. To maintain the recovery and achieve prosperity, we must face the same challenges our ancestors have all over the world."

Harry Bennett brought them together during the chaos of the American Civil War, forming the first Corporatocratic nation in the US and in the world.\nAs the civil war ended, the Union of Three Companies came into possession of many industrial centers, like Chicago and Detroit. As a result, their automobile manufacturing efficiency has improved, with many divisions there becoming motorized.\nHowever, the young nation is currently under threat from the Federated States of America in the east and the American Freedom League in the west.

 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_ENG:0 "In 1939, contrary to Neville Chamberlain's dreams of peace, the second World War in human history broke out. Declaring on Germany alongside Britain was France, which surrendered in the blink of an eye. The French and British troops besieged in Dunkirk launched Operation Dynamo in order to evacuate, but only a small part did so succesfully due to the German armored division's pursuit.\nChamberlain resigned after the surrender of France, admitting the failure of his Appeasement policy, and giving way to Edward Wood, Viscount of Halifax. However, the struggle of the air battle for the British mainland brought about a peace treaty with Germany.\nIn 1941, Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, aiming to solve its oil problem caused by the war against the Soviet Union. As the Third Reich didn't honor its obligations and declined to join, Britain lost the chance to turn things around, finalizing peace with the Germans through the Treaty of Brest in 1942.\nThe Conservative Party proposed to keep the coalition until the end of the war against the Japanese, but Labour was unwilling to accept this, making Edward Wood essentially \"capitulate.\" The British general election was held in 1943, and the Labour Party won by a huge margin.\n\nIn the war against Japan, the United Kingdom worked hard to defend Australia and India, not engaging in aggressive battles, but the sinking by aircraft of the Prince of Wales and the Repulse battleships during the Battle of Malaya shocked the British public. Although the United States Navy also struggled, the Hawaii Treaty of 1944 ended the conflict. Britain managed to survived this second war.\n\nThe Attlee administration established in rapid succession both a social security system and a nationalization program the likes of which couldn't be implemented during or after a war, overruling even King George VI's opposition. Starting with the 1945 National Insurance Law and the National Insurance Service Law, social security was established and extensive nationalization was carried out in a wide range of fields, including the Bank of England and the coal, mining, railways, electricity, gas, and steel industries. However, although the Attlee administration seemed to have got off to a good start, things started to get difficult.\nBritain was hit very hard by the very cold weather during January 1947 and the Labour govenment, unable to keep the food and electrical supplies, saw public support plummet. Not only that: even though the high-welfare high-taxes economic policy, known as \"From the cradle to the grave,\" was initially well-received, it began to show signs of a slump from 1948. This was due to the lack of work motivation caused by high welfare, and of economic growth from the high taxes. In addition, the City of London's emphasis on domestic investment weakened its role within global finance, hindering market revitalization. The British economy gradually began to stagnate and, as of 1950, experts say a crisis awaits if things are left unchecked.\n\nThe empire has rapidly decolonized since the end of the war: the costs of running the overseas territories were much higher than the benefits they gave back. Britain departed from imperialism in favor of exerting economic influence. The empire had begun to \"close up shop\" as early as 1940, when Gandhi's \"Quit India\" movement picked up steam.\nAfter the war, the empire steadily retreated and, in 1947, the Statute of Westminster was amended, turning the British Empire into the Commonwealth of Nations in both name and reality.\nAlthough Britain lost the war with Germany, it showed a good withdrawal tactic in the mean time, \"losing but winning.\" Still, many historic cities of the Old Continent - from Paris to Moscow - are still under oppression and tyranny. The United Kingdom will once again become the leader of European liberalism, breaking the oppressive regime that prevails on the European continent. In order to do so, it however needs to consult its subjects through new elections first."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_LIB:0 "Liberia had been unstable since its creation, its various problems including native discrimination by Americo-Liberians. As US influence diminished during the civil war, the country found itself on its own as an independent nation. However, there came a sudden influx of blacks escaping from the civil war, Liberia becoming tumultuous for a while. Most of them were part of the well-off middle class in America, so the Liberian administration used their money to help them settle. Then, William Tubman came to power in a situation where the people were divided in four factions: the black exiles, the Americo-Liberian, the natives, and the Muslims. Tubman first worked with the Americo-Liberians in a colonial oligarchic system. His aim was to alleviate their dissatisfaction and stabilize parliament. Of course, the other forces didn't keep silent, and set up their own political organization, in which Tubman also actively participated. When Americo-Liberians realized their power was gone it was too late, as they couldn't compete with the exiles, the natives, and the small number of Muslims who joined. So, they all built a political system in which they could work together. When it looked like all domestic problems had been solved, the factions realized that their cause was the lack of a common historical and cultural identity. Tubman now has to carry out new political reforms. In this world, newly-independent vulnerable nations are faced with serious decisions."

 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_GER:0 "Hitler had great and shining ambitions, his many talents undoubtedly given to him by Heaven.\nHe wanted to be a flame constantly illuminating the German people, and he succeeded: on the Western Front, his leadership skilks allowed the Reich to achieve an early peace, making them ready for total war against the Soviets. In 1944, he finally got the Communists to admit defeat, depriving them of any kind of hegemony over the world. However, all flames eventually go out. This is true even in his case. After the war, the Führer's talents were devoured by his drug addiction, his guiding leadership lost in the shadows before him. His influential subordinates don't worry about his fate, dreaming instead of becoming the heir of the Great Reich.\nWhat will happen to Greater Germany from now on? If his flame burns out, pure darkness will fall. However, no one can live in the dark."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_CHI:0 "§R・China§!\nChina has a long history, and has often been at the center of our world's culture. Still, during late Qing period the country was weakened by foreign intervention, leading to the dynasty's overthrow at the hands of Sun Yat-sen and his allies in the Xinhai Revolution, during the 3rd year of Xuantong's reign (1911). After that, incomprehensions between civilians and the military made the nation fall to warlordism. Among these local generals was Chiang Kai-shek, who gained leadership of the Kuomintang after Sun Yat-sen's death, completed the Northern Expedition, and reunified China in 1928 - although warlord influence remained strong. However, the 1930s brougth with them many hardships: the civil war against the Chinese Communist Party, beginning with the Shanghai Massacre, was especially fierce. The Japanese, taking advantage of the situation, invaded the northeast and proclaimed the birth of the state of Manchukuo with Puyi, last Qing dynasty emperor, as its ruler.\n§R・Crossoroads in Sino-Japanese relations§!\nThen-Prime Minister Kouki Hirota, also serving as Foreign Minister, appointed Mamoru Shigemitsu as his deputy. Under their diplomatic policy, they improved relations with China and secured peace through the \"Japan-Manchukuo-China Triple Alliance\".\nChiang Kai-shek's China, pursuing \"Annei Rangwai\" (Resisting Foreign Aggression after Stabilizing the Country), welcomed this move, and the Sino-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact was signed on April 12, 1936. Mutual inviolability was agreed, but since the Chinese didn't ratify the Gando and the Manchurian Treaties, the Kwantung Army protested, but were pacified by then-Vice Admiral Hideki Tojo, commander of the Kanto Kempeitai.\n§R・The Xi'an Incident§!\nChiang Kai-shek signed the non-aggression pact in April, but Zhang Xueliang, robbed by the Kwantung Army of his homeland Manchuria, categorically opposed the decision. As Zhang had also contacts within the Communist Party, Chiang considered him a dangerous element and planned to arrest him. In December, the Generalissimo personally led a platoon of soldiers to Xi'an, where Zhang was leading a barrier troops detachment, and arrested him. This became known as the Xi'an Incident. Zhang Xueliang would be detained in Nanking until Chiang's fall from power.\n§R・Chinese Civil War stalemate§!\nAfter the signing of the Sino-Japanese Non-Aggression Pact and the Xi'an Incident, Chiang Kai-shek resumed his fight against the Communists. Mao Zedong, trying to fend him off by proposing an anti-Japanese front, found himself in a difficult position, resisitng and waiting for support from the other socialist power: the Soviet Union. At first, the National Revolutionary Army struggled against Mao and his staff's military prowess, making it so that the goal of occupying Yan'an by the end of 1937 couldn't be achieved.\nDue to the Nationalists' overwhelming numbers, the People's Army exhausted itself with every passing day, taking losses that even USSR support couldn't replenish. Finally, Yan'an was taken in 1939. With the fall of Mao, the Communist fled to Sheng Shicai-controlled Xinjiang, the civil war stopping for the time being.\n§R・The Nanjing Decade§!\nIn the 10 years after the end of the civil war, the Chinese economy achieved dramatic growth. As the world was engulfed in war, China maintained peace and took a pro-Allied stance, gaining significant profits from its munitions industry and exports of daily necessities. Domestic industrialization progressed, and the scars left by the civil war were healing. However, when World War II ended, the military industry faltered and oversupply continued. Due to the rapid industrialization, poor working environments and pollution became a common social problem.\n§R・Fall of Chiang Kai-shek§!\nConcerned about declining support due to the failure of his economic policy, Chiang Kai-shek set out to eliminate the Communist Party in Xinjiang and the still-influential warlords, in order to solidify his position. Although the anti-communist offensive was successful, the warlords were made aware of the threat to their power, abducted Chiang Kai-shek, and forced him to resign. Soon after, although China was now de-facto led by the warlords, Gu Zhutong was appointed as Interim President as a concession towards the Kuomintang. The warlords now seek to establish a federal republic with local self-rule, but the Kuomintang believes that to be a betrayal of Sun Yat-sen and his Three Principles of the People. At any rate, this political gap must be bridged.\n§R・The future of China§!\nThere are still many problems in China: the battle for economic control, the political turmoil, and the growing tensions with Japan. China is at a crossroads. Can we endure?"

 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_BUL:0 "As World War II ended, Bulgaria was able to acquire most of Macedonia. As a result, Greater Bulgaria advocates gained more influence and, eventually, power. But in Bulgaria, a melting pot of ideologies due to its location, this resulted in political turmoil. The influx of communists, monarchists, and democrats during the Soviet Union's collapse added more fuel to the fire, while the death of Tsar Boris III seemed to indicate that the country was about to explode. In fact, many predict that some major upheaval will occur in the near future.\nHowever, we must overcome the crisis and make our country the greatest in Eastern Europe.\n\n…of course, this after we decide on an ideology to faithfully follow and bring to fruition."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_ROM:0 "On the winning side of the German-Soviet War, Romania became the biggest nation in the Balkans. Our joyous voices echoed all over Eastern Europe; voices of hope, inspired by victory. Just like plants and flower bloom and shine under the sun, so Romania flourished. However, in opposition with this hope, despair is just around the corner: order in Eastern Europe is maintained by German and Italian influence, but the Hungarians' territorial and ethnic hatred toward us is deeply rooted, their grudge growing by the day. If Germany and/or Italy were to exit the equation, war with Hungary would be unavoidable. In order to somehow protect ourselves, we must be fully prepared. Bulgaria also holds a grudge, though not as severe as the Hungarian one, so we should start by relieving tensions with them. Surely our sun will clear the darkness around Bulgaria, the same sun that points towards progress. We shall continue to move forward in order to protect hope and dispel this looming ​​despair."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_HUN:0 "No one doubts that Germany helped the small Kingdom of Hungary, born with the Treaty of Trianon, by giving it some of its old territories back through the \"Vienna Awards\". However, the decline of the German Führer, the ruler of Europe, is worrying. Would Romania comply with the Vienna Awards if Germany were to take its eyes off of the Balkans? Like at the end of 1918, they'd certainly cross Carpathia and steal Northern Transylvania from us! Still, Romania isn't our only problem: with Croatian independence, Yugoslavia split in two. At that time, its neighbors - ourselves included - had troops stationed to protect their own ethnic kin. If the Serbs were to plan to revive Yugoslavia, our country would inevitably be involved, alongside many others. Hungary's issues aren't limited to diplomacy: a still vacant throne, rising extremist ideologies, lack of economic development... It's been 30 years since our humiliating fragmentation. We have a long way to go to restore the Kingdom of Hungary of the past."

Even the democratic-conservative Nationalist Party has started to drift rightwards, having a great impact on Irish parliament.\nWe can either continue to defend democracy in this turbulent era, move to the right and submit ourselves to Germany, or support the workers and the people more and go Red.\nNo one can say which is the right choice..."

The lone lion in the snowy mountains will soon shed its pure white mane and look no different from the other beasts. That is reincarnation.\n\nStarting with the British intervention of 1904, Tibet underwent major transformations: modern technology in the form of wireless communication was introduced, modern troops to replace the Dob-dob monk soldiers were organized; new ideas, brought by the Chinese Communist Party and by the German expedition of 1939, also spread throughout the country. Even under these circumstances, the aristocrats and the monks continue their power struggle, Tibetan politics proceeding in a peculiar balance. But that isn't going to last.\n\nWith Chinese pressure increasing every day, and British support no longer a thing, keeping our independence won't be possible without modernizing our ways, religion included. On the contrary, if we aren't able to achieve modernity, we'll be destined to disappear and be forgotten, like Hotan in the north...\n\nThe Himalayas look down and watch over us.

 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_BHU:0 "Located at the foot of the great Himalayan mountains, Bhutan finds itself in the middle of a crossroads.\n\nAfter the Duar War of 1864-65, British aid and exchanges had continued despite the country's isolation. However, now nothing comes to Bhutan, except for a mere 100,000-Rupee annual grant, as stipulated by the Treaty of Sinchula, the only thing binding us to India. Speaking of India, we're no longer sure whether they'll protect us or not, as the Punakha Treaty has been abrogated.\n\nAlthough Bhutan gained its independence, the old-fashioned Penlop (Mayors), Je Khenpo (Abbots), and Druk Desi (Regent) are once again challenging the Druk Gyalpo (Thunder Dragon King) in various parts of the country. The central government and the royal court, heavily dependent on the British, are now unprepared, even militarily. In addition, there's the barrier of the various reforms, which must be overcome in order to reach the modern age. However, the ones most opposed to change are the people themselves.\n\nStill, the small but brave Thunder Dragon continues to effortlessly fly in the sky in a majestic and beautiful way, and even the great and wise Gangkhar Puensum won't be able to stop it. As soon as there's nothing blocking Bhutan's future, it'll just push forward."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_EAF:0 "In 1936, as the world got more embroiled in chaos with each passing day, a cunning, ferocious, and greedy eagle noticed a quiet, sleeping lion. Consumed by revenge, the eagle preyed upon the lion, founding a new empire in East Africa on its corpse.\n\nIn 1940, the government of the homeland decided to join the war against Britain and France after seeing the German Wehrmacht's superiority. Of course, East Africa had to follow suit, winning many battle in Somaliland with little supply in the early stages of the war. However, those were only the first few months.\n\nFrom the end of 1940 to the beginning of 1941 we found ourselves at a disadvantage in terms of troops and supplies. The Englishmen were like bugs at first, but gradually cornered us in East Africa. However, through some strokes of good luck, starting with a big victory in Egypt, we succeeded in defeating a large British army in the Battle of Gondar. World War II in East Africa turned into a triumph, and successful territorial expansion.\n\nStill, problems piled up: local rebellions at the hands of the \"Arbegnoch\" (Patriots) Ethiopian guerrillas, relations with the homeland, and refugees from the German colonies. It's up to us to figure out how to overcome this."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_VIN:0 "Since the 19th century, Vietnam has always been threatened by Western influence. In the 1820s, confrontation with France, which had become more influential by getting closer to the Qing dynasty, became inevitable. Despite its stubborn isolationist policy, Vietnam was gradually colonized by the western power and its overwhelming military, falling completely under its control by 1886. \n \nPatriots like Phan Boi Chau, Nguyen Tai Hoc, and Phan Chau Trinh fiercely resisted to save their country from this dire situation, but didn’t succeed. \n \nHowever, a reversal of fortunes came to Vietnam. During World War II, France surrendered to the German onslaught. Their suzerain split into the pro-Axis Vichy France, making peace with Germany, and Free France, which continued to fight against the enemy. \n \nThis division also affected the colony, with French Indochina aligning itself with the Vichy regime. Due to this, independence movements became active once again. \n \nSeeing the situation, the eastern superpower, the Empire of Japan, took notice of the French colony. In 1940, Japanese armies entered French Indochina in anticipation of the upcoming war against Great Britain and the United States. Vietnamese, Laotian and Khmer people hoped independence would finally come. However, as Japan was allied to Germany, they chose to keep the French administration and only stationed troops there. This was done as a way to avoid provoking Vichy France, and thus worsen Japanese-German relations. However, the relationship between the colonial government and the imperial army still collapsed when Germany refused to participate in said war, dissolving their alliance as soon as Japan declared war against the United States in December 1941. The empire, which had no reason to protect French Indochina, moved to dismantle the colony and make their concept of a Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere a reality. However, the Republic of China advanced its own army down to Tonkin, in northern Vietnam, in the name of protecting the Chinese and French Indochinese government. This led to various skirmishes between Japan and China, but full-scale war was averted by an armistice agreement between the two countries. \n \nOn March 11, 1942, the Empire of Vietnam was officially founded under Japanese military occupation, with Emperor Bao Dai as head of state. The country is effectively Japan's puppet, with famous historian Tran Trong Kim being selected as the first prime minister. During his administration, he promoted educational policies focusing on nationalism and economic independence. Although his education reform proceeded smoothly, Japanese influence couldn’t be ignored in terms of economic policy, and so full independence became difficult to achieve. The 1945 post-war famine also couldn’t be adequately dealt with, resulting in many deaths. Due to this, the influence of Ho Chi Minh's Viet Minh influence has also increased, becoming a huge burden to deal with. Can the Empire of Vietnam overcome the Viet Minh threat and Japanese influence, becoming a great nation once again?"
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_TOK:0 "Vietnam, under French colonial rule since the beginning of the 19th century, was once again given the opportunity to become independent as Japan moved into French Indochina with the aim of expanding southward. \n \nHowever, this was to be the beginning of turbulent times for Vietnam. Although Japan controlled the whole of Indochina, it cooperated with German-puppeted Vichy France's colonial government, for the sake of Japanese-German relations. However, these deteriorated rapidly in 1941, when Japan declared war on the United States. At that time, the Republic of China began to move into the Tonkin region of northern Vietnam in the name of protection of overseas Chinese and French Indochinese citizens, and the imperial army quickly responded to the provocation. The threat of full-scale war between Japan and China loomed, but it was prevented by the signing of a ceasefire agreement. \n \nChinese occupation of the Tonkin region continued and, in response to Japan establishing the Empire of Vietnam with Bao Dai as head of state on March 11, 1942, China set up a Republic in northern Vietnam on April 10, 1942 with the acquiescence of Vichy France. \n \nUnder strong Chinese influence, the Viet nam Dan Quoc was to be administered by people exiled to China after Yen Bai’s Vietnam Quoc dan Dang uprising of 1930. \n \nContrary to expectations for an independent nation, the outbreak of famine due to the arrival of Chinese troops, overseas Chinese growing influence, and French colonists still in power, the current situation is far from ideal for this divided land. Vietnam's fate is at the mercy of the Japanese and Chinese superpowers. Whether to enjoy prosperity under their overlord, or to achieve true independence, the Viet nam Dan Quoc will face a number of choices."
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_GEACPS:0 "Until then, they were western puppets.\nIt was as clear as water, and they even thought nothing would change. No bright future for them anymore, they had no choice but to go down the dark path.\n\nThen, to those who had given up on a future, the Rising Sun lit the way forward: the §tGreater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere§! concept. It was a new dawn. One of equal strength with the West. One of regional cooperation. One of victory and hegemony over Asia. Everything happened like an avalanche.\n\nHowever, the sun rises and sets. Japan, the main power behind the faction and the cornerstone of its economy, chose to disarm. Conflicts with China, rapidly growing with German support, arose. Other countries, using said issues as pretext, seeking to withdraw from the Sphere...\n\nOnce brightened by the Japanese sun, the world is becoming suspiciously cloudy. Apparently, sunset is near. What can they do to endure the cold and dark night that will follow?\n\n§tHowever, it would be good to remember that, once the sun sets, it will eventually rise from the east once again.§!"
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_COMMONWEALTH:0 "While violent totalitarianism overwhelmed continental Europe, the British Empire sought a way to escape from chaos.\nAs the Reich fought against Russia, our overlords tried to solve internal problems. The empire began to \"close up shop\".\nThe various colonies and protectorates, known as Dominions, became completely independent and regained control over their foreign affairs and trade. It was also up to each individual nation to decide whether to keep the King of England as head of state, that is, to remain in the empire, or not. Faced with said choice, we, long associated with our overlords, decided to remain.\nWe did so in preparation for the upcoming, renewed struggle against totalitarianism, and for a better future for our country.\nHowever, we also pray for our master to not make any more mistakes, for our trust in them is already ice-thin."

Hitler's declining health and his lackeys' struggle for power were a good enough reason to darken Greater Germany's bright future, conquered with war. Everyone dies eventually, so the Führer too would meet his end someday. We knew that, but who would've thought that his skills would die while he was still alive?\nStill, we don't have time to indulge ourselves in such sentiment. Someone's voice can be heard from the street:\n\"Germany is done. It's over. It's completely exhausted, and will be devoured by Russia. If that happens, we'll probably the first to be occupied!!!\".\nThat may be so... No, he's a dissident and must be shot. He must be silenced as quickly as possible. Still...\nUnrest in Germany was more serious than we expected."

 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_ALF:0 "World War II was truly a nightmare for the United States. While the effects of the Great Depression still lingering, the civil rights movement within the country and other various problems, it had entered war with Japan. However, back then all American expected the war to end with overwhelming might of the US industry, taking a devastating blow on the far eastern island nation. Like the previous world war, they believed that they were the ones to change the course of the war. However, the war was completely different, who they fought, where they fought, even the cause. Yet still there was one thing that never changed, it was none other than America itself. Its arrogance had given victory to Japan and to Asia. America was defeated. But even in such misery, many Americans found hope rather than despair. They stood up to bring back America, once again. The civil rights act which was promoted by the Republican party and the Democratic party was one of them. They believed that it was the best option for America. Despite the cause, it was another loss for America. This time to themselves. The rebellion by the Federalist Pary which opposed the civil rights act, the crumbling U.S. Armed Forces, and States seceding from the Union to combat fascist tyranny. The nightmare never ended. United States of America, which had been a country of freedom and democracy, was now just a small nation on the continent, and the country that had been full of dreams and hopes had become a hell of madness and chaos. But even after being tortured and torn apart so much, they still haven't given up. The United States of America, a shining example of freedom and democracy. Will they be able to survive? And if they do, what will they do with it?"
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_CAN:0 "The effects of the Great Depression, a global recession that began with the stock market crash in the great country to the south, the United States, caused severe damage to the Canadian federation. Prime Minister Mackenzie King's nationalization of the Bank of Canada brought us out of the Depression, and we managed to survive World War II without lowering the standard of living of our people.\nHowever, we saw the unexpected consequences of this world war. In Europe, France surrendered in the blink of an eye, there was constant bombing of the British mainland, and Germany won a decisive victory on the Eastern Front. Meanwhile, in the Far East, the Pacific War broke out, and the U.S. fleet, said to be the largest in the world, was crushed by Japan's proud United Fleet. India was liberated from the British, and our empire lost the greatest jewel in its crown.\nTo make matters worse, in 1949, the federal government of the great United States collapsed. Some democratic leaders fled to the west, hoping for a chance to win back their country. On the other hand, the democrats in the New England area have established the \"New England Commonwealth\" and are under the protection of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries.\nOur military is characterized as an overseas expeditionary force, not an army designed to fight on the mainland in vast border battles. The chaos in the US threatens us. The Commonwealth realm, and by extension the Canadian Commonwealth, should unite to tackle this problem.\nThe current Prime Minister, $CAN_louis_st_laurent$, has gained tremendous support through his extensive use of mass media. His political skills are top-notch, and he will surely lead Canada in the right direction. French-Canadians are enthusiastically supporting the federal government as it finally has its second Québécois prime minister in its history. The $CAN_louis_st_laurent$ cabinet plans to reform various aspects of the government, such as industry, social welfare and the military, in order to maintain the status of \"middle power.\""
 COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION_ARG:0 "After the 1938 elections, President Roberto decided to focus on fixing the economy first. He developed light industry by effectively utilizing the infrastructure left by the previous administrations. However, the budget deficit remained, and industrialization didn't progress well.\n\nIn 1939, World War II started when Germany declared war on Poland. As a result, exports increased and an unprecedented economic boom came about. The country received a lot of foreign currency and, by hiring engineers from abroad, technological and industrial advancements were promoted. However, behind the scenes, with the Pacific War beginning and the end of war in Europe after the London Treaty, social and political unrest grew at a dizzying pace. In 1942, Roberto resigned as president because of diabetes.\n\nCastillo succeeded him in the same year and decided to continue his foreign policy. Castillo's goal was to eliminate corruption within at both the national and local level. He carried out some nationalist policies, like establishing the Directorate General of Military Manufacture, whose job was to promote heavy industry for domestic ammunition production purposes. In other matters, he was more authoritarian: he fired bureaucrats and dissolved city councils that lost popular confidence due to corruption allegations. Aligning with former President Ortiz's measures against fraudulent elections, he disbanded the decrepit Concordancia, consolidating the conservative party's support base. This was to pre-emptively stop new electoral violations.\n\nIn 1941, as the Pacific War began and social unrest grew, Castillo declared a state of siege to ban Allied protests and activities questioning neutrality. The situation carried over in 1942, when a corruption scandal, whose sensational coverage stimulated public opinion, impressed the people with how much corruption was about and how liberal democracy had declined: the children tasked with announcing the winning lottery numbers planned to cheat, resulting in an investigative committee being set up under the leadership of a member of parliament. The people were also shocked by seeing how military cadets could also wield the power of their superiors to their own advantage.\n\nThe military became aware of the fact that a coup d'etat was essential to wipe out social corruption. \nIn the June of 1943, army troops incurred many casualties in their battle against the Marines as they marched towards the Presidential residence in Buenos Aires, but with Castillo arrested and the infrastructure under their control, the overthrow was successful.\n\nArturo Rawson was inaugurated as President, but resigned three days later due to lack of support from the military. His successor Pedro Pablo Ramirez established the Fraud Investigation Commission, which revealed the domestic corruption mechanisms present since 1936, including government officials' internal telegraph exchanges. He also dissolved the Universities Association, introduced religious education, and established the Policia Federal Argentina. An industrial credit fund was also set up in order to provide cheap, long-term loans to the industrial sector."

This is a very powerful system, as it can attack while ignoring air superiority. The range depends on the missile type, which can be equipped with either Conventional and Nuclear warheads. Missiles with nuclear warheads will result in a nuclear attack, while other types will damage specific buildings within the targeted state. Once an attack is made, you will have to wait some time before being able to attack again. If the target is located within a nation with a war goal against you, a war declaration will be issued at the time of the missile attack.

This means that the more densely populated an area is, the greater the loss of population; conversely, less inhabited areas will suffer less. So, if you wish to recruit troops from conquered states, nuclear weaponry may not be a good option.\nSecondly, these armaments have two launch methods: the vanilla one (strategic bomber attack plus clicking the button on the state details screen), and the state-by-state one by using ballistic missiles from the Missile Tab. With the former, you can specify the province in a state and consume only one nuclear bomb at a time, but the latter allows you to ignore air superiority and cruising range issues, and to carry out simultaneous attacks relatively easily. When carrying out a nuclear attack by way of ballistic missiles, you'll need to convert nuclear bombs into nuclear warheads first."
