 peasantism_ideology_desc:0 "Agrarianism is a pre-World War II Japanese ideology that insists that agriculture shoud be at the base of the nation. The idea of ​​agrarianism is best expressed by the phrase \"Agriculture is our foundation\". In early modern Japan, during what can be regarded as its prehistory, it stressed the importance and protection of agriculture and farmers in order to maintain the shogunate, but after the Meiji Restoration and the industrial revolution, that is to say, the dismantling of rural society in favor of industrialization, the Agrarian-rural Society was established as a response, with the aim of maintaining and helping agriculture survive. Therefore, Agrarianism can be regarded as an extremely modern ideology/movement first established in modern times under peculiar historical conditions and, strictly speaking, different from the agrarian ideas that arose in Japanese feudal society. After World War I, especially during the Rural Depression caused by Great Depression of the late 1920s, the survival of Japan's small and medium-sized farms was at stake. As a result, a new type of Agrarianism which was anti-modern and critical of the current system emerged, developing in connection with ultranationalists, that is to say, fascists. The ideas of Kozaburo Tachibana, who participated in the May 15 Incident and insisted on reform based on farmer-soldiers, and of Sir Seikyo Gondo, who aimed to establish rural autonomy, had in many cases great influence on young military officers hailing from small and medium-sized farms, becoming an important ideological premise for the February 26 Incident."
