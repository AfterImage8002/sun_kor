As a result, this new weapon has a barrel strength comparable to a light machine gun in order to achieve high precision and, although it has a low firing rate, it's very accurate, adding this to the level already reached in the original development concept.

This, along with the weight reduction of the gun body, it has become possible to load more bullets. Inheriting the high precision and durability of the Type-21, it succeeded in extending its range, becoming a weapon that is very easy to handle."

In addition, since its operating method is different, special measures are required, so unless it's use is considered from the design stage, it's often developed separately.

Therefore, the Army started developing new weapons the year immediately after the adoption of the Type-6. However, since the Chinese Federation was a potential enemy, and the main objective was to defend the Manchurian border, a new low-rate (thought to be a waste of ammunition) rifle with a bipod mount was developed, with reference to the German StG41. It was adopted in 1951 as the Type-11 Automatic Rifle."
