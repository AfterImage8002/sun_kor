 soner_1940:0 "Sonar I"
 soner_1940_desc:0 "Submarine detection technology evolved rapidly during World War II. The battlefield spread from the sea surface to the skies as well as underwater, with emphasis placed on countermeasures for torpedoes and submarines. By listening to the enemy submarine's driving sound through a sonar, its location can be found, and depth charges can then be dropped to sink and repel it."
 soner_1944:0 "Sonar II"
 soner_1944_desc:0 "With Passive Sonar, aka identifying enemy submarines by listening to the sound they make, their noise was often drowned out by others, like the driving of one's own ship. The Active Sonar doesn't listen for submarines, the device itself making a sound which reflection points out the enemy's position."
 soner_1948:0 "Sonar III"
 soner_1948_desc:0 "With the development of sonar, submarine technology also evolved, with more skill being required to identify the enemy's position. Therefore, some of the analysis perfomed by humans was mechanized in order to further improve its accuracy."
 soner_1952:0 "Sonar IV"
 soner_1952_desc:0 "Active Sonars can locate the enemy without other sounds getting in the way, but the ship itself would also be detected by submarines as long as it made noise. By improving not only the Active Sonar, but also the Passive one, we'll be able to identify the enemy submarines' position without the detecting us."
 soner_1956:0 "Sonar V"
 soner_1956_desc:0 "Until now, sonars could only detect one direction at a time, but now their technology has enabled detecting in multiple directions at once. This will improve the efficiency of anti-submarine warfare even further."
 soner_1960:0 "Sonar VI"
 soner_1960_desc:0 "We've developed a highly-efficient, sound-catching material, and achieved better accuracy by improving its casing and shape. Also, underwater acoustic research has made it possible to expand its detection range."
 soner_1964:0 "Sonar VII"
 soner_1964_desc:0 "In order to stop the enemy from pinpointing the location of our ships via the Active Sonar, the Passive one will continue to be improved."
 soner_1968:0 "Sonar VIII"
 soner_1968_desc:0 "Rather than searching for submarines with separate ships, let's connect multiple ships and ground facilities via communication to better counter them. Using extremely low frequencies will also enable longer detection ranges."
 soner_1972:0 "Sonar IX"
 soner_1972_desc:0 "Installing a Passive Sonar under the sea surface where enemy submarines are thought to be active will enable wide-area searches alongside the ships' own sonars and anti-sub weapons. However, their quietness and mobility is developing remarkably, with the sonar's limit to detect submarines steadily approaching."
 aircraft_radar_1940_desc:0 "During World War II, Radars were deployed mainly on the ground and at sea, rarely being installed on aircrafts. Still, in quite a few cases they were mounted on planes operating in low-visibility conditions, like with night-deployed fighters."
 aircraft_radar_1944_desc:0 "Around the end of World War II, Radars were installed not only on night-operating planes, but also on All-weather Fighters. However, this technology was still underdeveloped, and easily blockable by clouds."
 aircraft_radar_1948_desc:0 "With the advent of Jets, the time to engage the enemy was shortened, and so Radars came to be installed on ordinary aircrafts. They were considered a more reliable alternative to the naked eye when enemy planes couldn't be visually tracked."
 aircraft_radar_1952_desc:0 "With the birth of SAMs (Semi-active Missiles) requiring third-party radar acquisition, Radars were turned into a Fire Control linked to the missile system. Still, the locking mechanism was known to be unstable, easily releaseable, and being deceived by countermeasures like Chaffs."
 aircraft_radar_1956_desc:0 "This Aircraft Radar had its look-down capabilities enhanced in order to respond to enemy planes invading at low altitudes and high speed, tactic that reduced their detection rate. Pulse-Doppler radars were also developed, taking into account any errors caused by the Doppler Effect."
 aircraft_radar_1960_desc:0 "With the advent of Fire Control Radars, integrating Radars and Fire Control, searching and engaging during air combat became easier. Detection distance was also increased, with combat becoming less reliant on eyesight in most circumstances."
 aircraft_radar_1964_desc:0 "As aircraft-mounted electronic equipment has evolved, so has the fire control radar. In addition, the radar performance during combat has been improved in consideration of maneuverability during visual combat."
 aircraft_radar_1968_desc:0 "With the advent of fire-control radar and infrared search and tracking systems, air warfare has come to use a wide variety of weapons in a wide variety of situations. As a result, the radar, the eyes of the aircraft, has undergone a corresponding evolution."
 aircraft_radar_1972_desc:0 "With planes now equipped with state-of-the-art Fire Control Radars, the two systems have evolved to handle anti-air, ground, and naval combat using missiles. With the evolution of electronics, the aircrafts themselves have become more digital and computer-like."
 fire_control_1941:0 "Fire Control System I"
 fire_control_1941_desc:0 "In the past, it was necessary to input information by hand into the Fire Control and Navigation Tables, but the Radar made it possible to control them both in conjunction with itself. This greatly improved the artillery's accuracy and, as a result, many ships were equipped with it as an alternative, or as an add-on, to the Laser Rangefinder."

 air_to_air_missile_1951_desc:0 "Air-to-air missiles have their roots in Anti-air Rockets: at the beginning, the two mainstream homing methods were the infrared, which mainly utilized the exhaust heat of hostile aircraft engines, and the semi-active radar guidance, locking on the enemy through the launcher's radar and guiding the missile."
 air_to_air_missile_1954:0 "Air-to-Air Missile II"
 air_to_air_missile_1954_desc:0 "Improvements, like an extended range and tip-equipped seeker, were made, but many problems remained: missile accuracy is still low, infrared-homing systems mistakenly identify the sun as a heat source, and semi-active radar missiles depend on the mother machine's performance."
 air_to_air_missile_1957:0 "Air-to-Air Missile III"
 air_to_air_missile_1957_desc:0 "Alongside technological innovation, air-to-air missiles' performance has also improved: instead of conventional, naked-eye visible battles performed after visually supplementing the enemy aircraft, long-distance and out-of-sight fights using radars to catch hostiles are also taking place."
 air_to_air_missile_1966:0 "Air-to-Air Missile IV"
 air_to_air_missile_1966_desc:0 "Until now, emphasis was put on extending the missile's range and power, but by taking into consideration low-altitude battles, improvements were made mainly on the weapon's guidance system and mobility. At the same time, air-to-air missiles came to be differentiated between short, medium, and long range."
 air_to_air_missile_1975:0 "Air-to-air Missile V"
 air_to_air_missile_1975_desc:0 "In the past, target lock-on was possible only with infrared rays, capturing the exhaust heat of the enemy aircraft's engine, but it then became viable to do this even from the sides, gaininh omni-directional engagement ability. In addition, Active Radar Homing Missiles - with missile-mounted radars for targeting - have also appeared, further improving the missiles' usefulness in battle."
 ship_to_ship_missile_1951:0 "Ship-to-ship Missile I"
 ship_to_ship_missile_1951_desc:0 "With the range of ships' anti-aircraft fire being increased, traditional swoop bombing became a thing of the past. So, VT fuzes radar-guided rockets became the mainstream underwater-diving weapons. Once issued, this model was mainly mounted on medium bombers. Still, its range being shortened by the wire-based guidance made the installation of wireless guidance devices, already used in Glide Bombs, an urgent ussue."
 ship_to_ship_missile_1954:0 "Ship-to-ship Missile II"
 ship_to_ship_missile_1954_desc:0 "Once wire-guided guidance became obsolete, wireless equipment and limited infrared homing were adopted to improve the survival and hit rates of the mother machines. As for the guidance method, the choice was between intermediate range, then leaving it to the infrared, and mother machine-led terminal steering. However, since it has rocket engine propulsion, range is still short, leading many to consider equipping the next model with a turbojet engine."
 ship_to_ship_missile_1957:0 "Ship-to-ship Missile III"
 ship_to_ship_missile_1957_desc:0 "The miniaturization of the extended-range fuel tank, the installation of a turbojet engine, and the increased amount of explosive charge were the main improvements for this model. For the first time, a shaped charge point was mounted on the warhead, making it easy to penetrate armor up to 150 mm. Still, since a new guidance system wasn't yet developed, the hit rate remained a problem."
