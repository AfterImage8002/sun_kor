 ship_hull_heavy_1_short:5 "Battleship I"
 ship_hull_heavy_1_desc:5 "On the eve of World War II, battleships made their final evolution, with \"fast battleships\", having both speed and attack power, appearing in particular. They were used for a wide variety of purposes, like escorting carriers escorting and destroying commerce fleets. However, as it later turned out, battleships would no longer be the protagonists of future naval warfare."
 ship_hull_heavy_2:5 "Large Hull II"
 ship_hull_heavy_2_short:5 "Battleship II"
 ship_hull_heavy_2_desc:5 "After World War II, battleships were already revealed to be an outdated concept, but many were still built during the war or under the strong pressure of some country leaders. It's really unknown whether these battleships will see action on the front lines or not."
 ship_hull_heavy_3:5 "Large Hull III"
 ship_hull_heavy_3_short:5 "Battleship III"
 ship_hull_heavy_3_desc:5 "After World War II, amongst the majority saying that battleships were no longer the main force in a navy, a faction daring to focus on this type of ships emerged. According to them, with the battleship's heavy armor, it will possible to advance to the front lines alongside the aircrafts, and attack. Whether or not this military strategy will be successful, no one can really say."
 ship_hull_heavy_4:5 "Large Hull IV"
 ship_hull_heavy_4_short:5 "Battleship IV"
 ship_hull_heavy_4_desc:5 "While battleships are being used in different ways from the conventional ones, their structure and design has changed. Regarding the inferiority of surface ships to airplanes, anti-aircraft weapons have been strengthened to deal with this, but the reality is that friendly aircraft support a major operational premise."
 ship_hull_heavy_5:5 "Large Hull V"
 ship_hull_heavy_5_short:5 "Battleship V"
 ship_hull_heavy_5_desc:5 "With advanced radar, fire control systems, anti-submarine weapons, and so on, battleships have greatly improved their ability to act as capital ships. In addition, by replacing the conventional seaplane-equipped aircraft with a helicopter, it has become more modern, its different military uses being expanded."
 ship_hull_heavy_6:5 "Large Hull VI"
 ship_hull_heavy_6_short:5 "Battleship VI"
 ship_hull_heavy_6_desc:5 "With the development of advanced radar, air defense systems, and missiles, battleships have transformed from an \"offensive ship\" to a \"defensive ship\", capturing enemies on radar and protecting the fleet with the anti-aircraft firearms mounted on its large hull."
 ship_hull_heavy_4_nuke:5 "Large Nuclear Hull I"
 ship_hull_heavy_4_nuke_short:5 "Nuclear Battleship I"
 ship_hull_heavy_4_nuke_desc:5 "Along with the shift to nuclear power for military ships, there was talk of nuclear power for battleships as well. Nuclear power was thought to be the best way to power the huge hulls of battleships, as it did not require any real fuel and could produce a large amount of power, but as battleships were frontline vessels, the issue of radiation when hit by a projectile was also raised at the same time."
 ship_hull_heavy_5_nuke:5 "Large Nuclear Hull II"
 ship_hull_heavy_5_nuke_short:5 "Nuclear Battleship II"
 ship_hull_heavy_5_nuke_desc:5 "Although the risk of being hit by a bullet increases significantly, nuclear engines are still being used in battleships and other ships. This was because the problem of fuel was no longer an issue, and the space on the ship could be fully utilized. This was also because the range of the battle itself was becoming longer and longer, and battleships no longer had to be on the front lines of a gun battle."
 ship_hull_heavy_6_nuke:5 "Large Nuclear Hull III"
 ship_hull_heavy_6_nuke_short:5 "Nuclear Battleship III"
 ship_hull_heavy_6_nuke_desc:5 "Nuclear power was also adopted for large hulls other than carriers, with most battleships built in the later 1950s using this type of energy. The enormous amount of energy supplied by nuclear engines has greatly improved not only cruising range and speed, but also electric and electronic warfare capabilities. Nuclear-powered battleships are almost always equipped with powerful radars, being on the lookout against the skies."

They have some advantages, like the steam catapults using their high-power engine, but due to the difference in the hull model between battleships and carriers, there are quite a few structural problems."

As for the guidance method, the choice was between intermediate range, then leaving it to the infrared, and mother machine-led terminal steering. However, since it has rocket engine propulsion, range is still short, leading many to consider equipping the next model with a turbojet engine."
 anti_ship_missile_1960:5 "Anti-Ship Missile II"
 anti_ship_missile_1960_desc:5 "The miniaturization of the extended-range fuel tank, the installation of a turbojet engine, and the increased amount of explosive charge were the main improvements for this model. For the first time, a shaped charge point was mounted on the warhead, making it easy to penetrate armor up to 150mm. Still, since a new guidance system wasn't yet developed, the hit rate remained a problem."
 anti_ship_missile_1965:5 "Anti-Ship Missile III"
 anti_ship_missile_1965_desc:5 "A model with an improved hit rate by the use of radar and homing as guidance devices. The warhead was made into a high-performance explosive, lowering cruising altitude and reducing the chance of being detected. Also, it can be launched from submarines and is equipped with rocket boosters. This missile has low-flight capabilities, and further improvements are desireable."
 anti_ship_missile_1975:5 "Anti-Ship Missile IV"
 anti_ship_missile_1975_desc:5 "An improved model with sea-skimming abilities and a Turbofan Engine. Taking advantage this engine's good fuel efficiency at both subsonic and transonic speeds, sea skimming makes it possible for the missile to fly just below sea surface, popping up right in front the target and hitting it."
 anti_air_missile_1950:5 "Prototype Anti-Air Missile"
 anti_air_missile_1950_desc:5 "Its guidance system, using an embarassingly inaccurate device located on the mother ship, is almost non-existent. It is propelled by a rocket engine and hits its targets using a proximity fuse. In other words, it's a rocket launcher. Having a short range and low accuracy, improvements are needed."

 anti_sub_missile_1955_desc:5 "With the development of sonar, it became possible to attack submarines from a longer distance than with conventional mortars and depth charges. As a result, a new system was built that shoots rocket-powered depth charges and can hit submarines from far away."
 anti_sub_missile_1960:5 "Anti-Sub Missile I"
 anti_sub_missile_1960_desc:5 "Since it wasn't necessary to use rockets to fly depth charges, replacing them with nuclear depth charges or guided torpedoes was considered. This would also extend the range and make them evolve alongside sonar technology."
 anti_sub_missile_1970:5 "Anti-Sub Missile II"
 anti_sub_missile_1970_desc:5 "A small torpedo effective against submarines, able to be mounted on a small rocket, and launched by a dedicated device was developed after the previous model. The performance of the torpedo itself was also improved, making it more efficient against submarines."
 anti_sub_missile_1975:5 "Anti-Sub Missile III"
 anti_sub_missile_1975_desc:5 "By making it possible to launch the rocket not only from the dedicated device, but also from a missile launcher, the aim was to improve maintainability and efficiency during operation.
